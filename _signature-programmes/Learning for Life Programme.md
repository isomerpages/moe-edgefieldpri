<h3>Dance LLP</h3>
<p><strong><em>Objectives of Dance LLP:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In delivering holistic education with values inculcation and development
of 21st century competencies, the dancesport learning for life programme
is designed with the following objectives:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inculcate values of respect, team spirit and self-discipline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instill social graciousness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop self-confidence, determination, motivation and perseverance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop leadership capacity through collaboration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Dance?</h3>
<p>Every dance form has its own personal style and rigour. The students will
develop a variety of dance skills and will get the opportunity to even
fuse different dance forms together. It allows students to be more creative
and embrace the different flavours of dance forms and be empowered to come
up with their own unique dance set of sequence.</p>
<p>Through different dance forms including Creative dance and Dancesport,
students will learn about perseverance and self-motivation. Students can
be encouraged to solve different sets of problems through different dance
experimentation. It is important that students learn that if they do not
succeed, they need to try again. Being able to make mistakes, ask for help,
accept constructive feedback and make improvements are great skills to
have. When they master a complicated movement, they have a sense of accomplishment
that will encourage them to conquer other challenges throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Students strengthen their cognitive abilities and memory skills through
learning different choreographies. They develop enhanced sensory awareness
and learn nonverbal communication, which represents two thirds of all communication.
Different dance forms help build self-confidence with each new dance steps
they practice and master. It also enables students to develop interpersonal
skills, which is vital to a child's cognitive development. When students
are part of a group activity, such as a dance routine, they learn the importance
of teamwork and develop skills to work successfully in a group setting.
This helps students learn how to listen well, lead others and be patient.</p>
<p>Dancesport denotes competitive ballroom dancing, both a demanding sport
and a performing art. Its characteristics consist of physical strength,
agility, co-ordination, stamina, high level of fitness, discipline, teamwork,
grace, style and musical interpretation. Dancesport is a team sport by
nature and features total gender parity. The features of Dancesport allow
us to instill values in our students. Through the process, they learn to
work with their partners acquiring team spirit and be respectful of the
opposite gender. Students also develop discipline and perseverance through
perfecting the dance steps and honing the right character and attitude
through the programme.</p>
<h3>The Dance Programme</h3>
