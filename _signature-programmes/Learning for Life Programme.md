## Why Dance?

Every dance form has its own personal style and rigour. The students will develop a variety of dance skills and will get the opportunity to even fuse different dance forms together. It allows students to be more creative and embrace the different flavours of dance forms and be empowered to come up with their own unique dance set of sequence.

Through different dance forms including Creative dance and Dancesport, students will learn about perseverance and self-motivation. Students can be encouraged to solve different sets of problems through different dance experimentation. It is important that students learn that if they do not succeed, they need to try again. Being able to make mistakes, ask for help, accept constructive feedback and make improvements are great skills to have. When they master a complicated movement, they have a sense of accomplishment that will encourage them to conquer other challenges throughout their lives.

Students strengthen their cognitive abilities and memory skills through learning different choreographies. They develop enhanced sensory awareness and learn nonverbal communication, which represents two thirds of all communication. Different dance forms help build self-confidence with each new dance steps they practice and master. It also enables students to develop interpersonal skills, which is vital to a child's cognitive development. When students are part of a group activity, such as a dance routine, they learn the importance of teamwork and develop skills to work successfully in a group setting. This helps students learn how to listen well, lead others and be patient.

Dancesport denotes competitive ballroom dancing, both a demanding sport and a performing art. Its characteristics consist of physical strength, agility, co-ordination, stamina, high level of fitness, discipline, teamwork, grace, style and musical interpretation. Dancesport is a team sport by nature and features total gender parity. The features of Dancesport allow us to instill values in our students. Through the process, they learn to work with their partners acquiring team spirit and be respectful of the opposite gender. Students also develop discipline and perseverance through perfecting the dance steps and honing the right character and attitude through the programme.
