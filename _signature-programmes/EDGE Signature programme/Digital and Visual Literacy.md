<h2>EDGE Digital Literacy Programme</h2>
<p>Empowering Students to Think Critically, Act Responsibly, and Create Confidently
in the Digital Age.
<br>
<br><strong>Our Purpose</strong>

develop key 21st Century Competencies (21CC) such as:
<br>- Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills
<br>- Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking
<br>- Civic, Global and Cross-cultural Literacy
<br>
<br>Through hands-on learning, guided reflections, and collaborative projects,
students learn to become discerning, safe, and empowered digital citizens.</p>

the module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real-World Application: Projects mirror authentic digital tasks like poster
design or video production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values-Driven Use: Students are guided to use digital tools with empathy,
respect, and integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progressive Design: Skills and complexity deepen from foundational awareness
(P1) to creation and communication (P5).</p>
</li>
</ul>
