<h2>STEM Innovator Programme</h2>
<p>The STEM Innovator Programme is EFPS’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP),
designed to nurture sustainability-minded innovators. It empowers students
with 21st-century competencies—such as critical thinking, adaptability,
and creativity—through authentic and impactful learning experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This programme is a key component of the EDGE Curriculum, offering students
meaningful opportunities to explore sustainability challenges. Through
real-world problem solving, students build essential innovation skills,
take ownership of their learning, and develop the mindset to drive positive
change. The journey fosters student agency, equipping learners to become
confident changemakers aligned with EFPS’s vision of “Lives Empowered,
Lives Touched.”</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<h4>Primary 4: Food Sustainability</h4>
<p>All Primary 4 students investigate the issue of food waste in the school
community. Using the Design Thinking framework, they explore the problem,
empathise with stakeholders, generate ideas, and prototype tangible solutions.
Their efforts support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2: Zero
Hunger and 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Challenge: Conduct a school-wide food audit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcome: Design and prototype sustainable solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skills Developed: Empathy, problem definition, ideation, prototyping,
and presentation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Primary 5: Energy Conservation and Innovation</h4>
<h4>Tier 1 – Energy Conservation STEM Innovator (Mainstream)</h4>
<p>Building on their Primary 4 experiences, Primary 5 students identify and
address energy wastage at school and home. They use collaborative sketching
and storyboarding techniques to propose practical solutions for energy
conservation. Projects align with SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and
contribute to Singapore’s Green Plan 2030.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<h3>Our Design Thinking Approach</h3>
<p>At every level, students are guided by a structured Design Thinking process:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Empathise – Understand user needs through audits and interviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define – Frame clear, human-centered problem statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideate – Generate solutions using brainstorming strategies like Crazy
8s and SCAMPER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prototype – Build simple models to test and improve ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test &amp; Present – Share ideas and refine them through feedback</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process cultivates student resilience, creativity and a deep sense
of purpose in solving real-world issues.</p>
