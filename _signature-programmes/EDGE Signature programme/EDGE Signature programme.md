<h3><strong>21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies: A Key Direction for the EFPS Total Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>EFPS places 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (21CC) at the heart of
our Total Curriculum, in alignment with MOE’s national direction. This
strategic focus ensures that every student develops the values, skills,
and dispositions needed to thrive in a dynamic world.
<br>

<br><strong>The E.D.G.E. Signature Programme: Translating Vision into Action</strong>
