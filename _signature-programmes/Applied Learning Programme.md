<h1>Applied Learning Programme : Environmental Science &amp; Sustainability</h1>
<h2><strong>STEM-based Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Environmental Science and Sustainability</strong></h2>
<h4>Objective of ALP</h4>
<p><strong><em>Environmental Science and Sustainability Education</em></strong>&nbsp;is
our school’s Applied Learning Programme to help students connect their
knowledge with real-world application. The ALP is designed with the following
objectives:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture and develop students who will care deeply for the environment
and are change agents in contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop the necessary skills and values for the 21st&nbsp;century competencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the EDGE framework, the programme is designed to achieved the objectives
of the ALP.</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The 3E approach;&nbsp;<em>Exposure, Experience and Empower</em>&nbsp;enables
the school to inculcate in students the respect and love for the environment
and how to be the change agents in contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for all Students</strong>
</p>
<p>The 3Es are cascaded into 3 tiers to provide opportunities for all students.</p>
<p>For instance, under the “Exposure” Tier, students from P1 to P6 will learn
to appreciate the environment and be aware of the need to take care of
it through activities such as learning journeys, PAL, assembly talks and
recycling programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P3 to P6 students will get to “Experience” on specific environmental issues
and sustainable living by undertaking the SEIPW and being involved in learning
journeys. The SEIPW is multi-disciplinary in nature, integrating various
disciplines and inquiry-based learning and pupils will adopt design thinking
in carrying out the SEIPW.</p>
<p>In the “Empower” Tier, students with the aptitude will participate in
competitions such as Elementz and Vanda International Science Competition
to further develop their interests and passion. Through the ALP, students
will become&nbsp;<strong><em>self-directed learners</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>confident leaners</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>active contributors</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>concerned citizens</em></strong>.</p>
