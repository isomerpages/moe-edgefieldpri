Class: 4 Grace 

Edgefield Primary School has good programmes, interesting CCA choices, a friendly learning environment, approachable teachers, and a dedicated Principal. 

My daughter, an ex-Edgefielder, still fondly remembers the two-night P4 camp she had participated in. The camp was well-organized and conducted, prioritizing the children’s health and safety. As an Edgefield alumni, she feels grateful for all the opportunities she was given, which allowed her to grow in confidence to showcase her talent and realize her full potential. My son, who is currently an Edgefielder, is also under the care and guidance of empathetic teachers. 

Being a PSG member has helped me to be a part of various programmes the school offers for the holistic development of students. It has also helped me understand the education system and thus, has allowed for me to better support my children in their education journey. I would recommend Edgefield Primary School to my friends and family wholeheartedly.
