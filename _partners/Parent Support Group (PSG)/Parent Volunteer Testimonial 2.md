Name: Lakshmi PSG member <br>
Child name: Varun Vijayakumar <br>
Class: 4 Patience

I have been a parent volunteer with the school for the past 4 years. Edgefield Primary School adopts a holistic approach in education. With its friendly culture, the school has been very responsive to our needs.

As parent volunteers, we support the school in organizing events such as recess activities, Mother Tongue Fortnight and Sports Day. This gives us an opportunity to participate and watch our children while serving the school. Personally, I love participating in the buddy reading programme. It is a programme unique to Edgefield Primary School which helps to support children with difficulties in their language learning.

Being a parent, as well as PSG member, it has helped me to understand my child better. I learnt to be patient, calm and to respect my child’s decision. I believe in the choices that he has made. It is heartening to see how he has matured and become more responsible. All these could not have been achieved without the constant encouragement from his teachers. I would like to extend my gratitude to the school.
