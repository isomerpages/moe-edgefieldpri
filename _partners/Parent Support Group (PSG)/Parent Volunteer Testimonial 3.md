I have been a parent volunteer since 2014. My family and I were new to Punggol at that time so I joined the Parent Support Group (PSG) to learn more about the school and to get to know people in the neighbourhood.

I started my volunteer journey with the English and Tamil Buddy Reading Programme. I found the programme to be rewarding and a valuable learning experience for me. It was gratifying to guide the younger children in their reading. As a volunteer and later an EXCO member, I enjoyed organising various activities with the school. It was wonderful to witness the care and attention that the teachers in Edgefield took to plan educational activities to pique children’s curiosity in learning.

The teachers at Edgefield are very caring and committed towards the students. They are ever ready and willing to help if when parents reach out for assistance. My eldest daughter who is in Junior College now still fondly remembers her primary school teachers. This is the impact the teachers in Edgefield have on their students. My younger daughter is in her final year in Edgefield this year. I am grateful to both my children’s teachers for imparting valuable life lessons and helping them grow into well-rounded and caring individuals.
