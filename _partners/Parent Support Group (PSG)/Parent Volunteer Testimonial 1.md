Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) is one of the pioneer Primary schools in the Punggol estate. The school has a well-established framework and a very cooperative Parent Support Group (PSG).  

As a current member of the school’s PSG, I have been given opportunities to be involved in school activities such as Sports Day and Mother Tongue Fortnight. Being able to take on an active role in facilitating these activities has given me the priceless experience to be one step closer to my children and to better understand their learning journey in school.

Over the years, EFPS has made a conscious effort to keep up with the changing times. With state-of-the-art technology and an interesting curriculum to support the students’ learning needs, our children have a conducive learning environment that is well-maintained and clean.

The school functions seamlessly due to the years of experience and well-thought-through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are in place. The close calibration between the school staff and the PSG has indeed been pivotal in enriching the school experience of Edgefielders. Having these has allowed for a smoother transition for my children especially when they transitioned from kindergarten to primary one.

From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank Mr. Saw, the Principal of EFPS, all the non-teaching staffs and most importantly, all the teachers; the educators for their tireless sacrifice of countless hours in nurturing our future leaders and making my children’s primary school journey not just rewarding and fruitful, but also a very safe one.

I have been a parent volunteer with the school for the past 4 years. Edgefield Primary School adopts a holistic approach in education. With its friendly culture, the school has been very responsive to our needs.

As parent volunteers, we support the school in organizing events such as recess activities, Mother Tongue Fortnight and Sports Day. This gives us an opportunity to participate and watch our children while serving the school. Personally, I love participating in the buddy reading programme. It is a programme unique to Edgefield Primary School which helps to support children with difficulties in their language learning.

Being a parent, as well as PSG member, it has helped me to understand my child better. I learnt to be patient, calm and to respect my child’s decision. I believe in the choices that he has made. It is heartening to see how he has matured and become more responsible. All these could not have been achieved without the constant encouragement from his teachers. I would like to extend my gratitude to the school.
