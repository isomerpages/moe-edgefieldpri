Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) is one of the pioneer Primary schools in the Punggol estate. The school has a well-established framework and a very cooperative Parent Support Group (PSG).  

As a current member of the school’s PSG, I have been given opportunities to be involved in school activities such as Sports Day and Mother Tongue Fortnight. Being able to take on an active role in facilitating these activities has given me the priceless experience to be one step closer to my children and to better understand their learning journey in school.

Over the years, EFPS has made a conscious effort to keep up with the changing times. With state-of-the-art technology and an interesting curriculum to support the students’ learning needs, our children have a conducive learning environment that is well-maintained and clean.

The school functions seamlessly due to the years of experience and well-thought-through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are in place. The close calibration between the school staff and the PSG has indeed been pivotal in enriching the school experience of Edgefielders. Having these has allowed for a smoother transition for my children especially when they transitioned from kindergarten to primary one.

From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank Mr. Saw, the Principal of EFPS, all the non-teaching staffs and most importantly, all the teachers; the educators for their tireless sacrifice of countless hours in nurturing our future leaders and making my children’s primary school journey not just rewarding and fruitful, but also a very safe one.

I have been a parent volunteer with the school for the past 4 years. Edgefield Primary School adopts a holistic approach in education. With its friendly culture, the school has been very responsive to our needs.

As parent volunteers, we support the school in organizing events such as recess activities, Mother Tongue Fortnight and Sports Day. This gives us an opportunity to participate and watch our children while serving the school. Personally, I love participating in the buddy reading programme. It is a programme unique to Edgefield Primary School which helps to support children with difficulties in their language learning.

Being a parent, as well as PSG member, it has helped me to understand my child better. I learnt to be patient, calm and to respect my child’s decision. I believe in the choices that he has made. It is heartening to see how he has matured and become more responsible. All these could not have been achieved without the constant encouragement from his teachers. I would like to extend my gratitude to the school.

I have been a parent volunteer since 2014. My family and I were new to Punggol at that time so I joined the Parent Support Group (PSG) to learn more about the school and to get to know people in the neighbourhood.

I started my volunteer journey with the English and Tamil Buddy Reading Programme. I found the programme to be rewarding and a valuable learning experience for me. It was gratifying to guide the younger children in their reading. As a volunteer and later an EXCO member, I enjoyed organising various activities with the school. It was wonderful to witness the care and attention that the teachers in Edgefield took to plan educational activities to pique children’s curiosity in learning.

The teachers at Edgefield are very caring and committed towards the students. They are ever ready and willing to help if when parents reach out for assistance. My eldest daughter who is in Junior College now still fondly remembers her primary school teachers. This is the impact the teachers in Edgefield have on their students. My younger daughter is in her final year in Edgefield this year. I am grateful to both my children’s teachers for imparting valuable life lessons and helping them grow into well-rounded and caring individuals.

Edgefield Primary School has good programmes, interesting CCA choices, a friendly learning environment, approachable teachers, and a dedicated Principal. 

My daughter, an ex-Edgefielder, still fondly remembers the two-night P4 camp she had participated in. The camp was well-organized and conducted, prioritizing the children’s health and safety. As an Edgefield alumni, she feels grateful for all the opportunities she was given, which allowed her to grow in confidence to showcase her talent and realize her full potential. My son, who is currently an Edgefielder, is also under the care and guidance of empathetic teachers. 

Being a PSG member has helped me to be a part of various programmes the school offers for the holistic development of students. It has also helped me understand the education system and thus, has allowed for me to better support my children in their education journey. I would recommend Edgefield Primary School to my friends and family wholeheartedly.

I have been serving Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) for the past 6 years. My son graduated from EFPS last year and now, my daughter is in Primary 4. Over the years, I have become familiar with most of the teachers and staff of the school. They are friendly, caring and receptive people. I find that as a parent, I can share my concerns about administrative and academic issues with the school staff freely and honestly. There was a time when I was concerned about my son’s anxiety and approached the school for additional support. We were directed to a school counselor who helped us a lot by teaching him various strategies to cope with his anxiety. She eventually became his trusted friend till he graduated.  

Other than the few mentioned exceptional circumstances, I also find the teachers’ care for the children’s well-being and their focus on the holistic education very heartwarming. The school aims to develop every child to be a self-directed learner. The students are also exposed to mindfulness practice in school every morning and we have observed our daughter trying to put that into practice when she is feeling angry or irritated to calm herself.

We are thankful for the hard work and untiring efforts of the teachers and staff during the COVID situation for the past two years. As a parent, I have learnt so much from the home-based learning strategies. As a former teacher, I could better understand and appreciate all the efforts that went into planning each of the home-based learning lesson. As a core committee member of the PSG, I am really proud of our Buddy Reading Programme that is designed to support students with learning difficulties.

I wish the best for everyone in Edgefield Primary School, and I would like to convey my deepest appreciation and gratitude for the principal, teachers, and staff of the school. Finally, I would like to give my thanks to everyone for keeping our children motivated, happy and energetic through their journey in school.
