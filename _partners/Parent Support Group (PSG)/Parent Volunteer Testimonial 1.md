Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) is one of the pioneer Primary schools in the Punggol estate. The school has a well-established framework and a very cooperative Parent Support Group (PSG).  

As a current member of the school’s PSG, I have been given opportunities to be involved in school activities such as Sports Day and Mother Tongue Fortnight. Being able to take on an active role in facilitating these activities has given me the priceless experience to be one step closer to my children and to better understand their learning journey in school.

Over the years, EFPS has made a conscious effort to keep up with the changing times. With state-of-the-art technology and an interesting curriculum to support the students’ learning needs, our children have a conducive learning environment that is well-maintained and clean.

The school functions seamlessly due to the years of experience and well-thought-through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are in place. The close calibration between the school staff and the PSG has indeed been pivotal in enriching the school experience of Edgefielders. Having these has allowed for a smoother transition for my children especially when they transitioned from kindergarten to primary one.

From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank Mr. Saw, the Principal of EFPS, all the non-teaching staffs and most importantly, all the teachers; the educators for their tireless sacrifice of countless hours in nurturing our future leaders and making my children’s primary school journey not just rewarding and fruitful, but also a very safe one.
