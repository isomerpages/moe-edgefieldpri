Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) is one of the pioneer Primary schools in the Punggol estate. The school has a well-established framework and a very cooperative Parent Support Group (PSG).  

As a current member of the school’s PSG, I have been given opportunities to be involved in school activities such as Sports Day and Mother Tongue Fortnight. Being able to take on an active role in facilitating these activities has given me the priceless experience to be one step closer to my children and to better understand their learning journey in school.

Over the years, EFPS has made a conscious effort to keep up with the changing times. With state-of-the-art technology and an interesting curriculum to support the students’ learning needs, our children have a conducive learning environment that is well-maintained and clean.

The school functions seamlessly due to the years of experience and well-thought-through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are in place. The close calibration between the school staff and the PSG has indeed been pivotal in enriching the school experience of Edgefielders. Having these has allowed for a smoother transition for my children especially when they transitioned from kindergarten to primary one.

From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank Mr. Saw, the Principal of EFPS, all the non-teaching staffs and most importantly, all the teachers; the educators for their tireless sacrifice of countless hours in nurturing our future leaders and making my children’s primary school journey not just rewarding and fruitful, but also a very safe one.

I have been a parent volunteer with the school for the past 4 years. Edgefield Primary School adopts a holistic approach in education. With its friendly culture, the school has been very responsive to our needs.

As parent volunteers, we support the school in organizing events such as recess activities, Mother Tongue Fortnight and Sports Day. This gives us an opportunity to participate and watch our children while serving the school. Personally, I love participating in the buddy reading programme. It is a programme unique to Edgefield Primary School which helps to support children with difficulties in their language learning.

Being a parent, as well as PSG member, it has helped me to understand my child better. I learnt to be patient, calm and to respect my child’s decision. I believe in the choices that he has made. It is heartening to see how he has matured and become more responsible. All these could not have been achieved without the constant encouragement from his teachers. I would like to extend my gratitude to the school.

I have been a parent volunteer since 2014. My family and I were new to Punggol at that time so I joined the Parent Support Group (PSG) to learn more about the school and to get to know people in the neighbourhood.

I started my volunteer journey with the English and Tamil Buddy Reading Programme. I found the programme to be rewarding and a valuable learning experience for me. It was gratifying to guide the younger children in their reading. As a volunteer and later an EXCO member, I enjoyed organising various activities with the school. It was wonderful to witness the care and attention that the teachers in Edgefield took to plan educational activities to pique children’s curiosity in learning.

The teachers at Edgefield are very caring and committed towards the students. They are ever ready and willing to help if when parents reach out for assistance. My eldest daughter who is in Junior College now still fondly remembers her primary school teachers. This is the impact the teachers in Edgefield have on their students. My younger daughter is in her final year in Edgefield this year. I am grateful to both my children’s teachers for imparting valuable life lessons and helping them grow into well-rounded and caring individuals.
