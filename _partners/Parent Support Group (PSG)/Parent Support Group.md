**About Us** <br>
Our Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing mentioned that MOE seeks to strengthen the partnership with
Parent Support Groups in all schools. The school, parents, and ministries will work together to establish a
caring and enabling society that gives greater attention to the well-being of our children. PSGs also play
an important role to provide support to our parent community.<br>
<br>At Edgefield Primary School, our PSG comprises a group of enthusiastic and dedicated parents who
support the school programmes and activities to develop the students holistically. Over the years, our
PSG has grown from strength to strength and plays vital roles in our school&#39;s academic programmes (e.g.
Buddy Reading and Mother Tongue Fortnight), national events (e.g. National Day celebration and Racial
Harmony Day), and festive celebrations. By working hand in hand with the school, our PSG is involved in
the lives of our children, thus helping them reach their potential.<br>

**Our Vision**<br>
To be a valued partner in achieving the school&#39;s vision of &quot;Lives Empowered, Lives Touched&quot; by working
in close collaboration with the school.
Our Activities
The school and our PSG organize activities throughout the year, some activities are ongoing, whilst other
events are held annually. The support of all parents as partners in education is important in ensuring that
our children are developed to their fullest potential. We encourage all parents to be actively involved in
the school activities and everyone is welcome to come on board!
