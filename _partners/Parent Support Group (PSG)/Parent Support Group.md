## About Us
Education Minister Chan Chun Sing emphasized MOE's commitment to partnering with Parent Support Groups (PSGs) in all schools to foster a caring, supportive environment for children's well-being. <br>
<br>
<u>
Our Vision
</u>
<br>
To be a valued partner in achieving the school's vision of "Lives Empowered, Lives Touched" by working in close collaboration with the school.
<br>
<br>
<u>
Our Mission
</u>
<br>
To partner the school in nurturing and optimising the full potential of every pupil who endeavours to excel.

At Edgefield Primary School, our PSG consists of dedicated parents who
contribute to school programs, national events and festive  celebrations, enhancing students' holistic development.

Through activities like Buddy Reading, Mother Tongue Fortnight and community events, our PSG actively supports both academic and social aspects of school life, playing a crucial role in helping students reach their potential in collaboration with the school.

We encourage all parents to be actively involved in the school activities and everyone is welcome to come on board!
