In Minister Chan Chun Sing’s Ministerial Statement in parliament on 27 July 2021, he mentioned that MOE seeks to strengthen the partnership with Parent Support Groups in all schools. Working together will help in establishing a caring and enabling society that gives greater attention to the well-being of our children. PSGs also play an important role to provide support to our parent community. 

At Edgefield, a group of enthusiastic and dedicated parents support the school programmes and activities to develop the students holistically. Over the years, our PSG has grown from strength to strength. Our PSG plays vital roles in our school academic programmes (e.g. Buddy Reading and Mother Tongue Fortnight), national events (e.g. National Day celebration and Racial Harmony Day) and festive celebrations. By working hand in hand with the school, our PSG are involved in the lives of our children, thus helping them reach their potential.

Here are some pictures of our PSG in action:

Our PSG also aims to be a close knit community where parents help and support one another in their parenting journey. Bonding activities are organised so that parents can build camaraderie amongst themselves.

The support of all parents as partners in education is important in ensuring that our children are developed to their fullest potential. We encourage all parents to be actively involved in the school activities and we welcome all on board.
