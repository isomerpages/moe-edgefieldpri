In Minister Chan Chun Sing’s Ministerial Statement in parliament on 27 July 2021, he mentioned that MOE seeks to strengthen the partnership with Parent Support Groups in all schools. Working together will help in establishing a caring and enabling society that gives greater attention to the well-being of our children. PSGs also play an important role to provide support to our parent community. 

At Edgefield, a group of enthusiastic and dedicated parents support the school programmes and activities to develop the students holistically. Over the years, our PSG has grown from strength to strength. Our PSG plays vital roles in our school academic programmes (e.g. Buddy Reading and Mother Tongue Fortnight), national events (e.g. National Day celebration and Racial Harmony Day) and festive celebrations. By working hand in hand with the school, our PSG are involved in the lives of our children, thus helping them reach their potential.

Here are some pictures of our PSG in action:
