Student name: Tara Eswaran (4 Grace)

I have been serving Edgefield Primary School (EFPS) for the past 6 years. My son graduated from EFPS last year and now, my daughter is in Primary 4. Over the years, I have become familiar with most of the teachers and staff of the school. They are friendly, caring and receptive people. I find that as a parent, I can share my concerns about administrative and academic issues with the school staff freely and honestly. There was a time when I was concerned about my son’s anxiety and approached the school for additional support. We were directed to a school counselor who helped us a lot by teaching him various strategies to cope with his anxiety. She eventually became his trusted friend till he graduated.  

Other than the few mentioned exceptional circumstances, I also find the teachers’ care for the children’s well-being and their focus on the holistic education very heartwarming. The school aims to develop every child to be a self-directed learner. The students are also exposed to mindfulness practice in school every morning and we have observed our daughter trying to put that into practice when she is feeling angry or irritated to calm herself.

We are thankful for the hard work and untiring efforts of the teachers and staff during the COVID situation for the past two years. As a parent, I have learnt so much from the home-based learning strategies. As a former teacher, I could better understand and appreciate all the efforts that went into planning each of the home-based learning lesson. As a core committee member of the PSG, I am really proud of our Buddy Reading Programme that is designed to support students with learning difficulties.

I wish the best for everyone in Edgefield Primary School, and I would like to convey my deepest appreciation and gratitude for the principal, teachers, and staff of the school. Finally, I would like to give my thanks to everyone for keeping our children motivated, happy and energetic through their journey in school.
