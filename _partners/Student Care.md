<p>An Oasis Between School and Home</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Core Student Care Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Homework Supervision</em>
</p>
<p>At NASCANS, we support students in approaching their homework with focus
and responsibility. Our dedicated mentors provide supervision, guiding
students to stay on track as they complete their assignments. This helps
ease the homework routine for families and allows parents to enjoy more
quality time with their child at home.</p>
<p><em>Character Education</em>
</p>
<p>At NASCANS, character education is an integral part of our daily programme,
aimed at nurturing positive values and personal growth. Our approach fosters
an environment where children can build essential life skills that contribute
to their overall development and well-being.</p>
<p><em>Enrichment</em>
</p>
<p>At NASCANS, enrichment programmes are designed to enhance students' learning
experiences beyond the classroom. These programmes provide opportunities
for personal growth, creativity, and skill development in a variety of
areas. Students are encouraged to explore their interests, develop new
talents, and build confidence.</p>
<p><em>Outdoor</em>
</p>
<p>At Nascans, outdoor activities play a vital role in fostering physical,
social, and emotional development. Through carefully planned outdoor experiences,
students are encouraged to explore nature, engage in active play, and develop
teamwork and leadership skills. These activities not only promote a healthy
lifestyle but also provide opportunities for children to connect with their
environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NASCANS is supported by a dedicated team at our headquarters, bringing
decades of experience in the effective management and operation of student
care centres. Our team's expertise ensures that we consistently provide
high-quality care and support for students.</p>
