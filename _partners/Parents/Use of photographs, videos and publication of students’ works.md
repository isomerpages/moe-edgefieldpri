We would like to inform you that photographs/videos of students/parents taken at all school events by the official school photographers may be published on the school’s official media platforms (e.g., newsletters, school website, school Facebook, school Instagram and microsites) and will be used for briefings, workshops, community outreaches and other educational purposes. The school may publish photographs, videos and students’ works /achievements together with their names from time to time. 

When selecting photographs and videos to be put up, we will be mindful of the way our students may be portrayed in these contexts and how they may appear in them. We will not include photographs and videos which are in any way inappropriate. If you have concerns and strong objections in the school using the photographs or/and videos of your child/ward, please notify the school in writing or email us at [edgefield\_ps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:edgefield_ps@moe.edu.sg).
