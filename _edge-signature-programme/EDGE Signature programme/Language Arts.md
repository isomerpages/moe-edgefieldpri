<h2>Language Arts @ EDGE: Giving Every Child a Voice</h2>
<h3>Building Confidence Through Performance</h3>
<p>At Edgefield Primary, we believe that confident communication is the foundation
of future-ready learners. Through our Language Arts strand of the EDGE
Curriculum, students embark on a four-year developmental journey that nurtures
oracy, creativity, and collaborative expression.</p>
<p>From Primary 1 to 4, students experience progressive, performance-based
learning that brings the English language to life:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1 – Choral Reading</strong>
<br>Building foundational fluency and rhythm through collective voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 2 – Storytelling</strong>
<br>Exploring expression, emotion, and structure through narrative sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 3 – Readers’ Theatre</strong>
<br>Rehearsing character, dialogue, and teamwork in dramatic readings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 4 – Musical</strong>
<br>Integrating language, movement, and music into full-scale performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Each module is designed with intentional progression, allowing students
to grow as communicators across stages—experiencing, developing, growing,
and eventually, empowering others through performance.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Communication, Confidence, Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond language acquisition, our Language Arts programme gives students
a stage—literally and figuratively—to find their voice. Each module culminates
in a class or level-wide performance, where students proudly present their
work to authentic audiences including peers, teachers, and parents.</p>
<p>These showcases not only build oracy and confidence, but also:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promote student agency through creative decision-making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster collaboration and shared ownership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer visible milestones in every learner’s communication journey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Highlights from 2025</strong></h3>
<p>In Semester 1, our Primary 2 and 3 students lit up the stage with joyful
storytelling and dramatic flair. Their commitment, growth, and courage
earned resounding applause from families and friends. We’re excited to
see our Primary 1 and 4 students shine in upcoming terms!</p>
