## Mental Sums Challenge
**Mental Sums** is aimed at developing good memory habits, being proficient with numbers and to be able to do maths with greater accuracy, speed and ease. In Edgefield, the Mental Sums Challenge is conducted in Semester 2. The preliminary rounds are carried out in the student’s respective classrooms and the top from each class will be chosen to represent their class in the final round. The final round is conducted in the hall where the Class Champions compete against one another. Solving problems in front of an audience poses another challenge altogether but our students rise above all to emerge as Mental Math Champions!
