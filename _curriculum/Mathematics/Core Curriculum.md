<p>The Mathematical framework has been the cornerstone of Singapore Mathematics
Curriculum.&nbsp; The central focus is Mathematical Problem Solving which
is dependent on five inter-related components, namely Concepts, Skills,
Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition. In EFPS, we target to develop our
students in all five components.&nbsp; Our customised programmes and activities
allow our students deeper understanding and connectedness to the real-world
issues.</p>
