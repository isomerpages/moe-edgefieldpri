<h3>Mathematics @ Edgefield : Believe to See the Possibilities</h3>
<p>At Edgefield Primary School, &nbsp;we believe that every child has the
potential to thrive in mathematics when given the right environment to
grow, explore, and connect. Guided by our school’s motto, <em>“Believe to See,”</em> our
Mathematics curriculum is designed to spark curiosity, deepen understanding,
and build confidence in every learner.</p>
<p>Mathematics is more than just numbers—it is a way of thinking, reasoning,
and making sense of the world. Our curriculum reflects this belief and
is shaped by four key mission statements.</p>

<p><strong><em>Embrace Artful Living</em></strong><em><br>We celebrate the creativity and elegance of mathematics, helping students appreciate its patterns, structures, and the joy of discovery.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this holistic approach, we aim to develop mathematicians who not
only master skills and concepts but also approach challenges with confidence,
think critically, and find meaning in their learning journey.</p>
