The Mathematical framework has been the cornerstone of Singapore Mathematics Curriculum.  The central focus is Mathematical Problem Solving which is dependent on five inter-related components, namely Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition. In EFPS, we target to develop our students in all five components.  Our customised programmes and activities allow our students deeper understanding and connectedness to the real-world issues.
