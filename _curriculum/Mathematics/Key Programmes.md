**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN):** The ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support Mathematics learners in tackling four key issues of learning, namely, learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. ICAN lessons typically follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation. Teachers develop a growth mindset in the students through a series of strategies, encouraging progression instead of perfection.
