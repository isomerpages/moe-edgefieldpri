<h3>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</h3>
<p>The ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support
Mathematics learners in tackling four key issues of learning, namely, learning
gaps, language, motivation and memory. ICAN lessons typically follow the
FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.
Teachers develop a growth mindset in the students through a series of strategies,
encouraging progression instead of perfection.</p>

<h3>Excellence 2000 Mathematical (E2K)</h3>
<p>The E2K Programme, developed by Israel Centre for Excellence through Education
(ICEE), caters to pupils with talents in Mathematics. Initiated in 2019,
the programme is conceptualised as an enrichment programme to promote logical
Mathematical thinking. It aims to increase pupils’ interest, involvement
and literacy in Mathematics. The lessons and activities are largely inquiry-based
and problem-centered. Students will be involved in more hands-on activities
to solve problems.</p>

<h3>Math Interactive Learning Space</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;purpose of the&nbsp;<strong>Math Interactive Learning Space</strong>&nbsp;is
to make mathematical concepts come alive. It leverages on the natural affinity
that Math has with technology to make the learning of mathematical concepts
more fun by using games and videos. The interactive games on IPADs allow
students to be fully engaged in building mathematical concepts like multiplication
table and the four order of operations. Some of the games not only challenge
their conceptual understanding but also allow them to pit their mathematical
knowledge against one another. Hence, students are more motivated to work
on their mental calculations in order to emerge victorious.</p>
