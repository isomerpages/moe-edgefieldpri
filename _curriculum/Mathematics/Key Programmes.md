<h3>Dynamic Learning Approaches</h3>
<p>The teaching approach at Edgefield Primary School emphasizes interactive
and practical learning experiences. Teachers employ a variety of methods,
including hands-on activities, digital tools, and group projects, to make
mathematics both accessible and enjoyable. This method ensures that students
are not just passive recipients of information but active participants
in their learning journey.</p>
