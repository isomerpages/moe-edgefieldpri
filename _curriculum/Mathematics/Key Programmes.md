<h3>Excellence 2000 in Mathematics (E2K)</h3>
<p>The Excellence 2000 Programme caters to students with talents in Mathematics.
Initiated in 2019, the programme is conceptualised as an enrichment programme
to promote logical mathematical thinking. It aims to increase studentsâ€™
interest, involvement, and literacy in Mathematics. The lessons and activities
are largely inquiry-based and problem-centered. Students will be involved
in more hands-on activities to solve problems.</p>
