<h3>Learning Through Play</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Through Play (LTP) is a learning
approach that involves using play activities as a way of helping our P1
and P2 students explore their environment, learn new skills, and develop
their cognitive, social, and emotional abilities.&nbsp; Through play, our
students can develop a wide range of skills such as problem-solving, critical
thinking, social skills, emotional regulation, language, and communication
skills.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative Play (CP)</strong> is a learning approach
where students work together to achieve a common goal or to complete a
shared activity.&nbsp; Communication is key to successful collaborative
play. Students are advised to communicate openly throughout the activity
as they learn the importance of working together and supporting one another.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innovation Programme (IvP)</strong> is an integrated
learning experience that encourages students to break away from the compartmentalisation
of the different disciplines. &nbsp;Set against the backdrop of authentic,
world and social issues, IvP expands the scope of study by encouraging
students to understand and relate to real-life issues before designing
point-of-view solutions that reflect their approach towards solving them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, exploring the inter-relationships
and inter-connectedness of knowledge, the IvP aims to nurture citizenry
in every student, to encourage them to take ownership and action for world
and social issues around them, leaving a positive impact on the community.</p>
