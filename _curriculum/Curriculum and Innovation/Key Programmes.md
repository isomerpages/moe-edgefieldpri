<h3>Maker Education</h3>

aiming to foster comprehensive learner development. This approach is designed
to cultivate essential character traits vital for success across various
domains. Through project-based activities emphasizing creativity, collaboration,
and perseverance, students develop key attributes such as responsibility,
teamwork, resilience, and a growth mindset. Maker Education serves as a
catalyst for igniting intellectual curiosity, instilling in learners a
lifelong commitment to learning, and preparing them for academic and real-world
achievements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Collaborative Play at Upper Primary</h3>

to address real-world challenges. During this stage, students engage in
group projects to design and create solutions, fostering teamwork, cooperation,
and advanced problem-solving. Additionally, they refine their communication
skills, develop leadership qualities, and gain practical insights by applying
their knowledge to school projects. Embracing an iterative approach, students
learn to perceive failures as opportunities for growth and improvement,
fostering a growth mindset essential for future success.</p>
