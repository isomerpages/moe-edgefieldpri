## Key Programmes

     
**1.**&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Through Play (LTP) is a learning approach that involves using play activities as a way of helping our P1 and P2 students explore their environment, learn new skills, and develop their cognitive, social, and emotional abilities.&nbsp; Through play, our students can develop a wide range of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, emotional regulation, language, and communication skills.

**2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative Play (CP)** is a learning approach where students work together to achieve a common goal or to complete a shared activity.&nbsp; Communication is key to successful collaborative play. Students are advised to communicate openly throughout the activity as they learn the importance of working together and supporting one another.

**3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innovation Programme (IvP)** is an integrated learning experience that encourages students to break away from the compartmentalisation of the different disciplines. &nbsp;Set against the backdrop of authentic, world and social issues, IvP expands the scope of study by encouraging students to understand and relate to real-life issues before designing point-of-view solutions that reflect their approach towards solving them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, exploring the inter-relationships and inter-connectedness of knowledge, the IvP aims to nurture citizenry in every student, to encourage them to take ownership and action for world and social issues around them, leaving a positive impact on the community.
