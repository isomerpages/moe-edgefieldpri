<h1>Maker Education</h1>
<p>Our school incorporates Maker Education into our pedagogical framework,
aiming to foster comprehensive learner development. This approach is designed
to cultivate essential character traits vital for success across various
domains. Through project-based activities emphasizing creativity, collaboration,
and perseverance, students develop key attributes such as responsibility,
teamwork, resilience, and a growth mindset. Maker Education serves as a
catalyst for igniting intellectual curiosity, instilling in learners a
lifelong commitment to learning, and preparing them for academic and real-world
achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, Maker Education serves as a pivotal platform for nurturing 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (21CC) through experiential learning. It facilitates the development
of creativity, practical problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration,
communication, resilience, and technical literacy. By integrating knowledge
from diverse disciplines and promoting real-world application, Maker Education
equips students with the requisite skills and mindsets to thrive in today's
dynamic environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Learning through Play at Lower Primary</h2>
<p>In the lower primary years, Maker Education adopts a "learning through
play" approach, instrumental in fostering 21CC attitudes and dispositions.
Through engaging in playful activities, young learners cultivate curiosity,

abilities, develop effective communication and collaboration skills, and
build confidence and initiative in their learning endeavors.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Collaborative Play at Upper Primary</h2>
<p>Transitioning to the upper primary years, Maker Education evolves to emphasize
collaborative play, further enhancing 21CC skills and preparing students
to address real-world challenges. During this stage, students engage in
group projects to design and create solutions, fostering teamwork, cooperation,
and advanced problem-solving. Additionally, they refine their communication
skills, develop leadership qualities, and gain practical insights by applying
their knowledge to school projects. Embracing an iterative approach, students
learn to perceive failures as opportunities for growth and improvement,
fostering a growth mindset essential for future success.</p>
