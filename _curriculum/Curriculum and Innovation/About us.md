####Core Curriculum

At EFPS, we recognize every student has unique interests, strengths, and learning styles.  Our integrated curriculum aims to nurture Edgefielders into&nbsp;stewards of their world, capable of navigating the future with confidence, making a positive impact to the community and protecting our Singaporean way of life.

Through the promotion of student choice and voice, Edgefielders can be inspired to take ownership of their learning and shape their unique educational journey.

1.	Learning Through Play (LTP) is a learning approach that involves using play activities as a way of helping our P1 and P2 students explore their environment, learn new skills, and develop their cognitive, social, and emotional abilities.  Through play, our students can develop a wide range of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, emotional regulation, language, and communication skills.

**2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative Play (CP)** is a learning approach where students work together to achieve a common goal or to complete a shared activity.&nbsp; Communication is key to successful collaborative play. Students are advised to communicate openly throughout the activity as they learn the importance of working together and supporting one another.

**3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innovation Programme (IvP)** is an integrated learning experience that encourages students to break away from the compartmentalisation of the different disciplines. &nbsp;Set against the backdrop of authentic, world and social issues, IvP expands the scope of study by encouraging students to understand and relate to real-life issues before designing point-of-view solutions that reflect their approach towards solving them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, exploring the inter-relationships and inter-connectedness of knowledge, the IvP aims to nurture citizenry in every student, to encourage them to take ownership and action for world and social issues around them, leaving a positive impact on the community.
