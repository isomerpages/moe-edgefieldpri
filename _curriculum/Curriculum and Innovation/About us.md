Our integrated curriculum aims to nurture Edgefielders into&nbsp;stewards of their world, capable of navigating the future with confidence, making a positive impact to the community and protecting our Singaporean way of life.

1.	Learning Through Play (LTP) is a learning approach that involves using play activities as a way of helping our P1 and P2 students explore their environment, learn new skills, and develop their cognitive, social, and emotional abilities.  Through play, our students can develop a wide range of skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, emotional regulation, language, and communication skills.
