**The Free Learning Day (FLD)** is a conference-style learning event for students. Comprising of keynote and concurrent sessions, our P3 to P5 students decide what they would like to learn and choose their sessions, promoting choice and greater ownership of learning.

The sub themes for the FLD 2023 include green efforts, sustainability, healthy living, innovation as well as education career guidance. The speakers are from local companies, volunteers from our Parent Support Group as well as our alumni.

Free Learning Day was held on 24 &amp; 25 May 2023.&nbsp; Click&nbsp;[here](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/efpsfreelearningday/home)&nbsp;to access synopses of keynote and concurrent sessions held on Free Learning Day.
