<h3>Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>As part of our efforts to celebrate students’ achievements and progress,
the school finds opportunities to showcase students’ artwork during EDGE
celebrations and NDP. This “Street CreARTe” corridor on the 4th floor features
key artists and styles from various periods of Western and Asian art. Here,
students learn about art history and movements and are inspired by quotes
from famous artists and artworks.</p>

<h3>Learning Journey to Art Museum</h3>
<p>With the objective of developing a lifelong interest in the arts, the
Primary 4 students will have the opportunity to experience museum-based
learning at the National Gallery, extending their learning beyond the classrooms.
Students learn to appreciate Singapore’s art history through selected works
of the pioneer artists and to understand how artists used art to portray
the life and conditions, specifically focusing on Singapore during its
founding years.</p>
