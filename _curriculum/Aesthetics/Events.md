<h3><strong>Art Exhibition</strong></h3>
<p>As part of our efforts to celebrate students’ achievements and progress,
the school finds opportunities to showcase students’ artwork during Arts
Alive and in a Mini Art Exhibition during NDP. This “Street CreARTe” corridor
on the 4th floor also features key artists and styles from various periods
of Western and Asian art. Here, students learn about art history and movements
and are inspired by quotes from famous artists and artworks.</p>

learning at the National Gallery, extending their learning beyond the classrooms.
