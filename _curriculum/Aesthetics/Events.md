### National Day Art Exhibition and Art Emersion  

As part of our efforts to celebrate students’ achievement and progress, the school holds a National Day Art Exhibition annually. This “Street CreARTe” corridor on the 4th floor also features key artists and styles from various periods of Western and Asian art. Here, students learn about art history and movements and are inspired with quotes from famous artists and artworks.
