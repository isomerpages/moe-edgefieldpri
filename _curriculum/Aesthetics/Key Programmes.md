<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>Photography is one of the unique programmes in Edgefield. Learning photography
helps enhance visual literacy and the ability to communicate through images,
which is increasingly important in today's digital world. It improves attention
to detail and observation skills, as students learn to capture moments
and scenes effectively. It also encourages creativity and self-expression,
allowing students to explore their artistic side, boosting confidence as
they showcase their skills to others.</p>
