## Art Excursion

With the objective of developing a lifelong interest in the arts, the Primary 4 students will get to experience a museum-based learning at the National Gallery, extending their learning beyond the classrooms. Students learn to appreciate Singaporeâ€™s art history through selected works of the pioneer artists and to understand how artists use art to portray the life and conditions, in this case, that of Singapore in the founding years.
