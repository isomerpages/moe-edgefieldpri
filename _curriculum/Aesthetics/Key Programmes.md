<h3>Art Excursion</h3>
<p>With the objective of developing a lifelong interest in the arts, the
Primary 4 students will get to experience a museum-based learning at the
National Gallery, extending their learning beyond the classrooms. Students
learn to appreciate Singaporeâ€™s art history through selected works of the
pioneer artists and to understand how artists use art to portray the life
and conditions, in this case, that of Singapore in the founding years.</p>
