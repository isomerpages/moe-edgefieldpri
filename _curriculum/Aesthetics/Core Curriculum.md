life and caters to the needs and interest of all students by providing
a rich, well-rounded exposure to different art forms including music, dance,
drama and visual arts. Through the arts education, students develop confidence

towards the arts and life, find connect within themselves, with society
and people across cultures and develop 21st century competencies.</p>
