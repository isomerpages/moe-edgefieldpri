<p>The performing and visual arts curriculum aims to enrich our students’
learning experiences. We cater to the needs and interest of all Edgefielders
by providing rich and holistic exposure to the different art forms - music,
dance and visual arts.</p>

<h3><strong>Performing Arts Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Music elements, concepts and skills are spiralled up over the six years
of curriculum, enabling progressive development in achieving the desired
outcomes. The curriculum focuses on self-directed learning using emerging
pedagogies and thinking strategies to develop the students into critical
thinkers and self-directed learners.</p>

<h3><strong>Visual Arts Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>The art curriculum allows students to develop creative dispositions, build
students’ capacity to critically discern and process visual information
and communicate effectively. It also fosters students’ sense of identity,
culture and place in society.</p>
