<h3>Performing Arts Curriculum</h3>
<p>The performing and visual arts curriculum aims to enrich our students’
learning experiences. We cater to the needs and interest of all Edgefielders
by providing rich and holistic exposure to the different art forms - music,
dance and visual arts.</p>
<p>Through the arts education, Edgefielders develop:</p>

<h3>Visual Arts Curriculum</h3>

students’ capacity to critically discern and process visual information
