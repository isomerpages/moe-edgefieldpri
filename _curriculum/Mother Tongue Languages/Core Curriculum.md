Bilingual education is one of the cornerstones of Singapore’s education system. It has a positive effect on intellectual growth and enhances children’s mental development.&nbsp;In Edgefield, we design authentic learning activities to nurture proficient Mother Tongue language users who can communicate confidently and effectively and are rooted to their culture. We are also committed to promote greater use of ICT to better engage our children in learning Mother Tongue languages.&nbsp;
