<h3>Core Curriculum</h3>
<p>Bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s national identity. At Edgefield
Primary School, we design authentic and meaningful learning experiences
to nurture confident and proficient users of the Mother Tongue Languages
(MTL). Our students learn to communicate effectively in their MTL, appreciate
their cultural heritage, and connect with communities across Asia and the
world. We are committed to engaging students meaningfully in learning and
using their MTL both within and beyond the classroom. Through a differentiated
curriculum and innovative pedagogies—such as role-playing, storytelling,
and gamification—we seek to cultivate students’ interest, enhance their
skills, and deepen their connection to the language.
<br>
<br><strong>Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL)</strong>
<br>To support students with a strong interest and aptitude in their MTL,
Edgefield offers the Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) programme to
Primary 3 and 4 students. This early exposure enables students to attain
higher levels of proficiency and fosters a deeper appreciation of their
language and culture. The HMTL curriculum includes the study of ethnic
literature and aims to develop students' higher-order thinking skills.
This initiative complements the existing HMTL offering for Primary 5 and
6 students, broadening opportunities for enriched language learning.
<br>
<br><strong>Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP)</strong>
<br>For Primary 1 to 4 students who require&nbsp;additional&nbsp;support for
Mother Tongue, Bridging (CL) and&nbsp;Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP)
will be conducted. The programme is focused on building stronger foundation
in students’ oracy and literacy skills.&nbsp;Support lessons involve hands-on
activities demonstrating the practical usefulness of the languages. Interactive
learning materials like picture cards help students learn more actively
in small groups.
