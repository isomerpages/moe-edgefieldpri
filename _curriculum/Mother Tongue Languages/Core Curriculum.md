<h3>MTL Curriculum</h3>
<p>Bilingual education is one of the cornerstones of Singapore’s education
system. It has a positive effect on intellectual growth and enhances children’s
mental development.&nbsp;In Edgefield, we design authentic learning activities
to nurture proficient Mother Tongue language users who can communicate
confidently and effectively and are rooted to their culture. We are also
committed to promote greater use of ICT to better engage our students in
learning Mother Tongue languages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Higher Mother Tongue Programme (HMTL)</h3>
<p>Edgefield provides Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) for Primary 3
and Primary 4 students who demonstrate a keen interest and aptitude in
their Mother Tongue languages, allowing them to achieve proficiency at
the highest possible level. This allows more students to deepen their knowledge
and appreciation for these languages and their cultures from an early age.&nbsp;The
HMTL curriculum exposes students to ethnic literature, helping them develop
higher-order thinking skills. It also provides students with the opportunity
tolearn grammar and syntax through creative activities and games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offering of HMTL to Primary 3 and Primary 4 students will complement
the existing offering of HMTL to Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mother Tongue Support Programme</h3>
<p>For Primary 1 to 4 students who require&nbsp;additional&nbsp;support for
Mother Tongue, Bridging and&nbsp;Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP)
will be conducted . These&nbsp;specialised early intervention&nbsp;programmes
are conducted by trained school teachers. The programme is focused on building
stronger foundation in students’ oracy and literacy skills.&nbsp;Support
lessons involve hands-on activities demonstrating the practical usefulness
of the languages. Interactive learning materials like picture cards help
students learn more actively in small groups.</p>
