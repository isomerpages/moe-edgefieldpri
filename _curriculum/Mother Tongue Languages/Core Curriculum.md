Bilingual education is one of the cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. It has a positive effect on intellectual growth and enhances children’s mental development. In Edgefield, we design authentic learning activities to nurture proficient Mother Tongue language users who can communicate confidently and effectively and are rooted to their culture. We are also committed to promote greater use of ICT to better engage our children in learning Mother Tongue languages.

EFPS offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students with strong interest and aptitude in Mother Tongue languages to learn to as high a level as they can. This allow more students to deepen their knowledge and appreciation for these languages and their cultures from an early age.  HMTL curriculum expose students to ethnic literature, help them develop higher-order thinking skills, and learn grammar and syntax through creative activities and games. 

The offering of HMTL to Primary 3 and Primary 4 students will complement the existing offering of HMTL to Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.
