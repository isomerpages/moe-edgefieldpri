<p>Bilingual education is one of the cornerstones of Singapore’s education
system. It has a positive effect on intellectual growth and enhances children’s
mental development.&nbsp;In Edgefield, we design authentic learning activities
to nurture proficient Mother Tongue language users who can communicate
confidently and effectively and are rooted to their culture. We are also
committed to promote greater use of ICT to better engage our students in
learning Mother Tongue languages.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Higher Mother Tongue Programme (HMTL)</h2>
<p>EFPS offers Higher Mother Tongue Languages (HMTL) for Primary 3 and Primary
4 students with strong interest and aptitude in Mother Tongue languages
to learn to as high a level as they can. This allow more students to deepen
their knowledge and appreciation for these languages and their cultures
from an early age.&nbsp; HMTL curriculum exposes students to ethnic literature,
help them develop higher-order thinking skills, and learn grammar and syntax
through creative activities and games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offering of HMTL to Primary 3 and Primary 4 students will complement
the existing offering of HMTL to Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mother Tongue Support Programme</h2>
<p>For students who need&nbsp;additional&nbsp;help with their Mother Tongues,
Bridging and&nbsp;Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) will be provided
for Primary 1 to Primary 2 students and Primary 3 to Primary 4 respectively.
These&nbsp;specialised early intervention&nbsp;programmes are conducted
by trained school teachers, The programme focused on building stronger
foundation in students' oracy and literacy skills.&nbsp;Classes involve
hands-on activities demonstrating “the practical usefulness of the languages”.
Interactive learning materials like picture cards help students learn more
actively in small groups.</p>
