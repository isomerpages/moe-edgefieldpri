<h3>MTL Reading Programme</h3>
<p>To ignite students’ interest in reading Mother Tongue language stories,
we create many opportunities for students to read widely. During Mother
Tongue lessons, students are exposed to books of different genres. They
also access a variety of newspapers, hardcopy reading materials and recommended
titles specially curated for them in the school’s library collection.</p>
<p>The school also collaborated with parents to form the Buddy Reading Programme
to conduct reading activities in school for students who require greater
support in reading.</p>
<p>In Term 3, we provide opportunities for students to showcase the good
stories that they have read through bookmarks, comic strips and book reviews.</p>
