<h3>Key Programme</h3>
<p><strong>MTL Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>To cultivate positive reading habits from young,
we have embarked on a new structured reading programme, MTL-SOAR programme
in 2025. <strong>MTL SOAR</strong>&nbsp;programme is designed to designed
to <strong>Spark </strong>interest, <strong>Open </strong>minds, <strong>Appreciate</strong> cultural
heritage and <strong>Rise </strong>as confident readers. Primary 1 and 2
students will have 30 minutes of their MTL curriculum time set aside for
reading and library activities. It will be progressively rolled out to
all levels by 2029. To ignite studentsâ€™ interest in reading Mother Tongue
language stories, we create many opportunities for students to read widely.
&nbsp;We use resources such as reading passports, and recommended reading
lists curated with the National Library Board, to enhance existing efforts
in developing positive reading habits. The school also collaborated with
parents Volunteers to conduct Buddy Reading Programme for selected P1 &amp;
P2 students who require support in reading.</p>
