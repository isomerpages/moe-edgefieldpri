<h3><strong>Festive Celebrations</strong></h3>
<p>At Edgefield Primary School through the festive celebrations, students
not only deepened their understanding of their own cultures but also had
the opportunity to explore and appreciate the richness of others. This
meaningful exposure allowed them to recognize the shared values and common
threads across the three cultures, fostering a stronger sense of harmony
and unity in Singapore’s multicultural society.</p>
<p>Here are some of the Festive Celebrations that were organized:</p>
<p>Pongal, Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Dragon Boat Festival</p>
