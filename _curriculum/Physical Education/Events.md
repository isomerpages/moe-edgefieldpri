<h3>Key Events in Physical Education</h3>
<p>We believe that physical activity is essential for the overall development
of our students. Our PE programme is designed to be inclusive, engaging,
and fun, ensuring that every child can participate and grow. Here are the
key events we have planned for each level this year:</p>
<p><strong><u>Lower Primary (P1 and P2) Sports Carnival</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our annual Sports Carnival is a fun-filled event where our youngest students
participate in a variety of games and activities. From throwing and catching
activities to dribbling games, this event is designed to encourage teamwork,
coordination, and a love for physical activity. It's a day of laughter,
excitement, and plenty of energy!</p>
<p><strong><u>Middle Primary (P3 and P4)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>SwimSafer 2.0</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to promoting water safety and swimming skills,
we participate in the SwimSafer programme. This initiative helps students
learn essential swimming techniques and water survival skills. The programme
is both educational and enjoyable, ensuring that our students are confident
and safe in the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day Trip to Jacob Ballas Children's Garden</p>
<p>Students in Primary 3 will enjoy an educational and active day trip to
Jacob Ballas Children's Garden. This outing combines physical activity
with environmental education, allowing students to explore nature and learn
about plants and ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong><u>Upper Primary (P5 and P6)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>P5 Camp</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 students embark on an exciting camp adventure that focuses
on building leadership, teamwork, and outdoor skills. The P5 Camp is a
memorable experience where students participate in activities like high
challenge course, journeys and team-building exercises. It's an excellent
opportunity for personal growth and making lasting memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Inter-class Games</p>
<p>Upper primary students will also take part in Inter-class Games, where
they compete in various sports and games against their peers from other
classes. This event promotes friendly competition, teamwork, and school
spirit.</p>
<p>We are excited about these events and look forward to seeing our students
enjoy, participate, and excel in them.</p>
