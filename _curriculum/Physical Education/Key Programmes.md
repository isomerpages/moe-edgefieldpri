### Outdoor Education


Outdoor Education engages the studentsâ€™ sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations. Students develop appropriate outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others.

  

### Gymnastics


Gymnastics enhances overall body management and control through creative interpretation of movement and sequence. The learning experience starts within the boundaries of open-ended tasks, and progressively moves into more stylised gymnastic movements.

  

### Dance in PE


Dance in PE develops in students an understanding of rhythmic movement. It also enables students to express and communicate feelings and ideas through exploration, creation and performance.

  

### Striking & Fielding

Students are introduced games-related concepts such as Striking & Fielding which involves both fundamental and specialised skills and movement concepts.
