<h3>Digital Literacy @ Edgefield</h3>
<p>At Edgefield, we develop students' digital literacy through the key domains
of <strong>Find, Think, Apply, and Create</strong>. Our digital literacy
curriculum empowers students to be discerning information seekers, critical
thinkers and imaginative creators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each level from Primary 1 to 6 engages in <strong>digital literacy modules</strong> during
and outside curriculum hours. These modules are delivered through a range
of different modes, including platforms like P1 and P2 PAL and EDGE, as
well as through self-paced learning. We also nurture values and social-emotional
competencies through <strong>cyberwellness</strong> initiatives through school
talks, commemorative events and advocacy activities. &nbsp;Through a wide
range of learning experiences, our students learn to navigate the digital
world safely, apply technology meaningfully, and express ideas through
coding, multimedia, and collaborative projects.</p>
