Advancement in technology gives rise to more options for students to select varied modes, mediums, and platforms to express their ideas. At Edgefield, we want our students to have choices and understand how their choices impact their lives. They are considered digitally literate when they can curate digital content, connect and communicate digitally, and create digital multimodal products across a range of digital media platforms. Being digitally literate also requires them to take into consideration ethical and social practices embedded in learning and daily life.

Thus, the New Media Literacies programme aims to equip students with the abilities to curate, create and connect with others in the digital networked environment. Curate, Create and Connect are ways of interacting in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices (tacit norms and skills) governing the digital networked environment.
