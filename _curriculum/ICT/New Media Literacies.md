<p>Advancement in technology gives rise to more options for students to select
varied modes, mediums, and platforms to express their ideas. At Edgefield,
we want our students to have choices and understand how their choices impact
their lives. They are considered digitally literate when they can curate
digital content, connect and communicate digitally, and create digital
multimodal products across a range of digital media platforms. Being digitally
literate also requires them to take into consideration ethical and social
practices embedded in learning and daily life.</p>
<p>Thus, the New Media Literacies programme aims to equip students with the
abilities to curate, create and connect with others in the digital networked
environment. Curate, Create and Connect are ways of interacting in the
digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions
will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices
(tacit norms and skills) governing the digital networked environment.</p>
