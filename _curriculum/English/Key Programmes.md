<h3>Read Like a Reader, Read Like a Writer</h3>
<p>In our school, where reading is a joyful adventure, ‘Read Like a Reader,
Read Like a Writer’ is tailored to enrich our students’ literacy journey.
Students become explorers of literature, approaching stories with a double
lens. They first get lost in the magic as enthusiastic readers, then shift
gears to learn from the author's craft as writers. Through engaging activities,
lively discussions, and our vibrant reading culture, they unlock the secrets
that make words come alive, we aim to cultivate a love for reading while
nurturing essential writing skills. We equip students to become confident
readers and proficient writers, equipping them for academic success and
beyond.</p>
