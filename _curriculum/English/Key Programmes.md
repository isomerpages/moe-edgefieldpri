<h3><strong>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Programme &amp; Library Activities</strong></h3>
<p>At Edgefield, we believe that reading is the foundation of language learning
and a gateway to imagination, empathy, and critical thinking. Our reading
and library activities are thoughtfully designed to nurture a lifelong
love for reading while equipping students with essential literacy skills.
<br>
<br>Through the <strong>Extensive Reading Programme</strong>, <strong>buddy reading sessions with parent volunteers</strong>,
and a wide range of <strong>library-based activities</strong>, we create
meaningful and inclusive experiences that promote reading readiness, cultivate
positive reading habits, and foster joyful, independent readers. The presence
of parent volunteers as reading buddies strengthens our learning community
and reinforces the value of shared reading—encouraging students to read
with confidence and enthusiasm in a safe, supportive space.
<br>
<br>Students are encouraged to explore a variety of genres and text types,
helping them appreciate diverse perspectives and understand the contexts
in which texts are written. Our programmes provide opportunities for students
to express personal responses—both written and verbal—allowing them to
connect deeply with the stories they read. From book talks and storytelling
sessions to reading challenges, thematic library corners, and interactive
buddy reading, our carefully curated activities not only build comprehension
and fluency but also inspire curiosity and thoughtful reflection. At Edgefield,
we do not just teach students to read—we invite them to discover the power
and pleasure of reading, together with the community that supports them.</p>

<p><strong>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1 to P4 Language Arts Modules</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Building Confidence Through Performance</strong>
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, we believe in nurturing confident and expressive communicators.
To develop our students' spoken language skills, we have designed a 4-year
English Language Arts (EDGE) programme that progressively builds their
confidence and competency in oracy through performance-based learning.</p>
<p><strong>Our EDGE journey includes:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1 – Choral Reading</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 2 – Storytelling</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 3 – Readers’ Theatre</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 4 – Musical</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Students engage in a rich array of language and performance strategies
that help them grow as communicators. These modules offer meaningful opportunities
for students to practise their oracy skills, work collaboratively, and
explore creative expression.
<br>
<br>The culmination of each module is a class performance—an adapted drama
or musical—where students proudly showcase their learning, talents, and
teamwork on stage.
<br>
<br>In Semester 1 of 2025, our Primary 2 and 3 students put up delightful
level-wide performances for their parents. The overwhelming support from
families and the students’ perseverance and enthusiasm made each performance
a resounding success. We look forward to our Primary 4 and Primary 1 students
taking the stage in Term 3 and Term 4 respectively!
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, every child is given a voice—and a stage to shine.

<p><strong>C)   Oracy Programmes</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Nurturing Every Edgefielder into an Empathetic Communicator</strong>
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, we believe that confident and empathetic communication is
key to personal and academic success. Our oracy programmes are thoughtfully
designed to develop every Edgefielder into an effective speaker who can
express ideas clearly and connect meaningfully with others.</p>
<p>Anchored in <em>Erik Palmer’s Six Traits of Speaking</em> (PVLEGS©)—<strong>Poise, Voice, Life, Eye Contact, Gestures, and Speed</strong>—students
are equipped with the essential tools to speak with confidence, clarity,
and impact.
<br>
<br>Our progressive oracy journey includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1 – Show and Tell</strong>: Building confidence and sharing
personal experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 2 – Pick and Tell</strong>: Encouraging spontaneity and
descriptive language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 3 – Public Speaking</strong>: Developing structured speech
and presentation skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 4 – Persuasive Speaking</strong>: Learning to craft arguments
and influence audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 5 &amp; 6 – Debate Programme</strong>: Honing critical
thinking, reasoning, and respectful discourse.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these platforms, students learn to listen actively, speak thoughtfully,
and engage in dialogue with empathy and purpose.
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, every voice matters—and we ensure every student is heard.</p>
