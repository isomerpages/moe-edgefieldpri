Like STELLAR 1.0, 2.0 programme continues to adopt research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage students in the learning of English. The
key strategies include Shared Book Approach (SBA), Close and Critical Reading, Supported Reading, Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA), Guided Writing, Process Writing and Extensive Reading. A period a week has been ringfenced in the EL curriculum to cultivate the love of reading in the
students.

Learning Support Programme
---------------------

LSP is a specialised early intervention programme that aims to provide additional support in language and literacy skills in Primary 1 and 2. Students are identified through the Early Literacy Indicators, a group screening instrument developed by MOE, at the beginning of each year. Support in LSP is delivered through a daily withdrawal teaching programme conducted by specially trained teachers. Lessons are held daily for 30 minutes.
