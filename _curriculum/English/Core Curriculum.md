<h3>English Curriculum</h3>
<p>Every child a <strong><em>confident speaker</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every child </em><strong><em>a storyteller</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every child </em><strong><em>an author</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Here at Edgefield, our aim is to cultivate a love for the English language
and develop students into articulate and confident communicators. We believe
every child can be a confident speaker, a captivating storyteller, and
an aspiring author.</p>
<p>We achieve this by engaging them in meaningful and immersive learning
experiences that foster critical thinking, empathy, and creative problem-solving
skills. These experiences equip students for success in the 21st century
by encouraging them to become:</p>
<p><strong>Empathetic Communicators -</strong> Actively listen, articulate
thoughts clearly, and collaborate respectfully.</p>
<p><strong>Discerning Readers -</strong> Develop broad perspectives, independent
thinking, and the ability to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Inquirers -</strong> Explore real-world issues, gather
diverse information, and co-create solutions.</p>
<p>By nurturing these skills, we prepare our students to thrive in a world
that demands clear communication, critical thinking, and the ability to
connect with others.</p>

<h3>Learning Support Programme</h3>

in LSP is delivered through a daily withdrawal teaching programme conducted
by specially trained teachers. Lessons are held daily for 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</h3>

to raise the reading competency of students who are not making sufficient
progress in the development of literacy skills at the end of Primary 2
at the word and text levels and are not dyslexic. Its objectives are to
enable students to fluently read and comprehend grade-level texts.</p>
<h3>School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme</h3>
