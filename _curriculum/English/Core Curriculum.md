This is a flagship programme by MOE/CPDD and has been reviewed to support the enactment of the English Language Syllabus 2020 (ELS 2020). It focuses on strengthening the foundation in four language areas: grammar, oracy, writing and reading while placing a greater emphasis on the reading-writing connection and reading comprehension skills.

Like STELLAR 1.0, the STELLAR 2.0 programme continues to adopt research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage students in the learning of English. The key strategies include Shared Book Approach (SBA), Close and Critical Reading, Supported Reading, Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA), Guided Writing, Process Writing and Extensive Reading. A period a week has been ringfenced in the EL curriculum to cultivate the love of reading in the students.
