<h3>Core Curriculum</h3>
<p><strong>English Language at Edgefield Primary School</strong>
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, we believe every child has the potential to be a confident
communicator. Our English Language curriculum focuses on laying a strong
foundation while enriching students’ learning through meaningful and engaging
language experiences.&nbsp; We lay this foundation through extensive reading
and frequent language use, ensuring students have access to quality texts,
storytelling sessions, and platforms to share their thoughts. Our programmes
are designed to spark curiosity and develop a deep appreciation for the
English language, while cultivating critical thinking and creative expression.
<br>
<br>Language is not just a subject—it is a powerful tool for connection, exploration,
and growth. Beyond the classroom, our students are given diverse opportunities
to apply their learning through engaging activities such as public performances,
language games, and collaborative projects. These experiences encourage
them to speak with confidence, write with purpose, and listen with empathy.
As empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers,
our students learn to navigate real-world issues, express their ideas clearly,
and work respectfully with others. At Edgefield, we are committed to nurturing
articulate speakers, captivating storytellers, and imaginative authors—empowering
every child with the voice and platform to shine in a rapidly changing
world.
<br>
<br>At Edgefield, every child is given the voice—and the platform—to shine.</p>
