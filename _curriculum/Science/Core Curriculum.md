<h3><strong>Science Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Our Science curriculum provides students with a strong foundation in Science
for life, learning, citizenry and work. Through our curriculum, we aspire
our students to be Inspired by Science, Inquire like Scientists and Innovate
using Science.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Leveraging on studentsâ€™ curiosity and their innate nature to explore things
around them, we equip them with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Core ideas of Science</p>
<p>(ii) Practices of Science</p>
<p>(iii) Values, Ethics and Attitudes in Science</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these core ideas, practices, values, ethics and attitudes, our students
will be curious and interested about Science, themselves and the environment.
They will also acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand
themselves and the world around them. Through experiences and opportunities
in Edgefield, our students will not only develop skills, dispositions,
and attitudes for Scientific inquiry, but also apply scientific concepts
and skills in making responsible decisions. With a mindset guided by the
right values and ethics, they will also appreciate how Science influences
people and the environment.</p>
