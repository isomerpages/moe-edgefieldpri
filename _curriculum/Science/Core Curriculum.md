Our Science curriculum aims to inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry in our students. Leveraging on the studentsâ€™ curiosity and their innate nature to want to explore things around them, we equip them with (i) knowledge, understanding and application of Science, (ii) process skills and (iii) the right ethics and attitudes. With these knowledge, skills and attitudes, they will actively apply them in their daily lives, society and the environment in order to improve the lives of others.
