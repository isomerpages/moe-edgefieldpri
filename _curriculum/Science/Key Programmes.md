### Inquiry-Based Science Programmes  

To cultivate a sense of inquiry in their quest for Science knowledge and in life, we design hands-on experiences for students to explore, experience, experiment and investigate. 

### Primary 3 - Gardening @ The Edge

Our eco-garden serves as the best learning place for our young students to learn observation and classification skills.

### Primary 4 - Experiential learning on hydroponics

In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Hydroponics is introduced to the Primary 4 students to instil the goal of a sustainable future, where we can get out needs through locally produced food. Students experience the process of growing their own food in the hydroponics programme.

### Primary 5 - Science Investigative Project

After two years of exposure to Science concepts and experiments, the Primary 5 students are now ready to carry out their own investigative projects. Students research on questions related to real life situations and conduct their experiments to find answers. 

Through such experiences, our students will become:  
•	self-directed learners who question, reflect, persevere and take responsibility for their own learning; <br>
•	active contributors who are able to work effectively in teams, are innovative, exercise initiative, take calculated risks and strive for excellence.
