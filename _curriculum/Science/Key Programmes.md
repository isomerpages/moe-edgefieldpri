### P5 - Science Investigative Project

After two years of exposure to Science concepts and experiments, the Primary 5 students are now ready to carry out their own investigative projects. Students research on questions related to real life situations.  
  

Through such experiences, our students will become:

*   self-directed learners who question, reflect, persevere and take responsibility for their own learning;
*   active contributors who are able to work effectively in teams, are innovative, exercise initiative, take calculated risks and strive for excellence.
