<h3>Inquiry-Based Science Programmes</h3>
<p>To cultivate a sense of inquiry in their quest for Science knowledge and
in life, we design and specially hands-on experiences for students to explore,
experience, experiment and investigate.</p>
<h3>P3 - Gardening @ The Edge</h3>
<p>To cultivate a sense of inquiry in their quest for Science knowledge and
in life, we design and specially hands-on experiences for students to explore,
experience, experiment and investigate.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>P4 - Experiential learning on hydroponics</h3>
<p>In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Hydroponics is introduced
to the Primary 4 students to instil the goal of a sustainable future, where
we can get out needs through locally produced food. Students experience
the process of growing their own food in the hydroponics programme.</p>

<h3>P5 - Science Investigative Project</h3>
<p>After two years of exposure to Science concepts and experiments, the Primary
5 students are now ready to carry out their own investigative projects.
Students research on questions related to real life situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through such experiences, our students will become:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-directed learners who question,
reflect, persevere and take responsibility for their own learning;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; active contributors who are able
to work effectively in teams, are innovative, exercise initiative, take
calculated risks and strive for excellence.</p>

<h3>P6 - Learning Journeys to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</h3>
<p>In this learning journey, students get a chance to examine real specimens
and learn more about the structural adaptations of various animals, including
extinct animals.</p>

<h3>E2K Science Programme Singapore</h3>
<p>This programme, designed for Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate
a deep interest and ability in Science, is filled with many scientific
investigations involving advanced science concepts. The students are engaged
in scientific inquiry which will develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions
scientists possess.</p>
