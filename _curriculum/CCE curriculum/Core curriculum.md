<h3>CCE/FTGP</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional
skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities,
reflections and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive
Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.
Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education
and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education,
and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally
appropriate manner during the lessons.</p>
<h3>Social Studies</h3>
<p>Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world
issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning
experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge
and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives, allowing them to be effective
citizens as they better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore
and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human
experience.
