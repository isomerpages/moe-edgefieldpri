<h2>CCE Curriculum</h2>
<h3><strong>CCE aims to develop in our students:</strong></h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Good Character</strong>: Have a sound moral compass and
a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning
in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards
others and strive for excellence;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being</strong>: Have
a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when
faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude
and appreciation;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Future Readiness</strong>: Have a sense of purpose in
life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so
as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and
take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Active Citizenship</strong>: Develop a strong national
identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in
themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities
and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others,
and building a future for our nation.</p>
<h4>CCE/FTGP</h4>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional
skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities,
reflections and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive
Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.
Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education
and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education,
and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally
appropriate manner during the lessons.</p>
<h4>Social Studies</h4>
<p>Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world
issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning
experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge
and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives, allowing them to be effective
citizens as they better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore
and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human
experience.</p>
