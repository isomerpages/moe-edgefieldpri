## National Education Commemorative Days
Schools commemorate four core NE days which have been identified as defining moments in our Singaporeâ€™s history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.

## Total Defence Day
Commemorated on 15 February annually, Total Defence Day seeks to remind all students of the sufferings endured by our forefathers during the Japanese Occupation. It is an occasion to re-familiarize ourselves with the modern defence strategy of "Total Defence" which Singapore has adopted to ensure our continued survival and security.
