<h3>National Education Commemorative Days</h3>
<p>Schools commemorate four core NE days which have been identified as defining
moments in our Singaporeâ€™s history. The aim is to entrench these events
and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.</p>
<h3>Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>Commemorated on 15 February annually, Total Defence Day seeks to remind
all students of the sufferings endured by our forefathers during the Japanese
Occupation. It is an occasion to re-familiarize ourselves with the modern
defence strategy of "Total Defence" which Singapore has adopted to ensure
our continued survival and security.</p>

an open mindset and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners
living, working and studying in Singapore.</p>
