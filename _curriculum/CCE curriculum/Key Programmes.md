### 1. Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)

CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education, and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons.

### 2. Social Studies


The Social Studies curriculum complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing citizenship dispositions. Through these lessons, students deepen and broaden their understanding of what it means to be a citizen of a country and the world by learning key concepts and skills drawn from Humanities subjects like Geography, History and Sociology.

### 3. V-Ed (Values Education Programme)

The CCE department has adopted a drama-based instructional approach to the teaching and learning of values. Based on educational research, drama is an effective pedagogy that connects content, skills, attitudes and values. It is student-centric and when implemented effectively, it will deepen conversations and understanding of concepts and issues presented. Based on learning theories, our students learn best when they can co-construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences.

### 5. National Education Commemorative Days
Schools commemorate four core NE days which have been identified as defining moments in our Singapore’s history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.

### 6a. Total Defence Day
Commemorated on 15 February annually, Total Defence Day seeks to remind all students of the sufferings endured by our forefathers during the Japanese Occupation. It is an occasion to re-familiarize ourselves with the modern defence strategy of "Total Defence" which Singapore has adopted to ensure our continued survival and security.
