### Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)

1. CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education, and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons.
