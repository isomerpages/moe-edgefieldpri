<h3>Total Defence</h3>
<p>We commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February each year to mark the
fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students
reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round&nbsp;response
to threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics,&nbsp;cyber-attacks,
influence campaigns or economic crises). Students also reflect on the continuing&nbsp;relevance
of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence,
Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence
- as well as the core message of every Singaporean standing together, each
playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TD40: 40 Years of Total Defence |&nbsp;<em>Together We Keep Singapore Strong</em></h3>
<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore. The focus for
TD40 will be on Singaporean’s readiness and resilience in the face of crises
and disruptions. Total Defence underpins our ability to deal with the ever-evolving
threats and challenges to Singapore. Every Singaporean plays a part in
our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises and disruption.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day</h3>
<p>We commemorate International Friendship Day on the 3rd Friday of Term
2. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations
with neighbouring countries and beyond. The commemoration of IFD allows
our students to be sensitised to Singapore's geopolitical realities, and
to reflect on the importance of&nbsp;an active foreign policy to maintain
Singapore's international space, openness to the international flow of
trade, ideas and talent, cross-cultural skills and a global orientation,
and the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.</p>
<h3>IFD Theme 2024 |&nbsp;<em>Singapore in Asia</em></h3>
<p>International cooperation remains key in our complex world. Asia is the
world's fastest-growing region, and Singapore continues to facilitate closer
economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and
in Asia. By recognising the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring
countries, our youth can play an active role in fostering people-to-people
ties, and thus celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy and promote
the spirit of friendship and collaboration. In addition, our older students
can deepen their understanding of Singapore's realities as a small state
and appreciate how we can safeguard our national interest and have much
to contribute to efforts at international cooperation.</p>

<h3>National Day</h3>
<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. The school-based commemoration
brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of
National Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Day Theme 2023 | Onward As One</strong>

confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one
