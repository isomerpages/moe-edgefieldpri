<h3>Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit
teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are
anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections
and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive Teacher-Student
Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships. Topics related
to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education and Career
Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education, and Sexuality
Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate
manner during the lessons.</p>

<h3>V-Ed (Values Education Programme)</h3>
<p>The CCE department has adopted a drama-based instructional approach to
the teaching and learning of values. Based on educational research, drama
is an effective pedagogy that connects content, skills, attitudes and values.
It is student-centric and when implemented effectively, it will deepen
conversations and understanding of concepts and issues presented. Based
on learning theories, our students learn best when they can co-construct
their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing
things and reflecting on those experiences.</p>
