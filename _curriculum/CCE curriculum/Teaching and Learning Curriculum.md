## Form Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)

Character and Citizenship Education (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education, and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons.

## V-Ed (Values Education Programme)

The CCE department has adopted a drama-based instructional approach to the teaching and learning of values. Based on educational research, drama is an effective pedagogy that connects content, skills, attitudes and values. It is student-centric and when implemented effectively, it will deepen conversations and understanding of concepts and issues presented. Based on learning theories, our students learn best when they can co-construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences.
