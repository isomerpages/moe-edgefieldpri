<p>About Cub Scouts</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At Edgefield Primary School, Cub Scouts is an exciting, fun-filled programme
that focuses on building character, encouraging personal growth, and fostering
a sense of community. Activities are driven towards “Fun &amp; Discovery”
amongst Cubs.
<br>
<br>Activities are conducted in school and Cubs are given opportunities to
go on learning journeys. As much as possible, Scout Teachers (known as
Akelas) adhere to the Scouting Method to have Cubs experience Scouting
as recommended by Scouts Association.
<br>
<br>It is open to all P3 to P6 students.</p>

<p>Cub Scouts have three progress levels to achieve from Primary 3 to Primary
6:
<br>1. Bronze Arrow Badge
<br>2. Silver Arrow Badge
<br>3. Gold Arrow Badge
<br>
<br>The highest award is the Akela Award which will require Cubs to complete
their Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge
of scouting and attend an interview with the District Commissioner.
<br>One of the yearly core activities is Job Week. There are 43 proficiency
badges, of which our school will definitely help our Cubs to achieve are
First Aider, Road Safety, Swimmer and Camper. National Campaign badges
like Young Aviator Level 1 &amp; 2 and Young Mariner Level 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>CCA sessions take the form of Opening Ceremony, activities for progress
badges (45mins to an hour), followed by games and songs. Sessions typically
concludes with a Closing Ceremony.
<br>Our Sixers and Assistant Sixers take turns to conduct the opening ceremony
while other Cubs take turns to lead games and songs. Cubs develop a sense
of pride and have opportunities to engage their peers.</p>

<p>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Scouting is a powerful complement to school-based values education, offering
real-world experiences that build character, competence, and compassion.
By engaging head, heart, and hands, Scouts truly support the holistic development
of every child — helping them become responsible, kind, and capable global
citizens.
<br>
<br>A feature of activities conducted is to ignite enthusiasm and teamwork
within the Pack. Cubs develop resilience through continuous practice and
repeated attempts to ensure the completion of given tasks.
<br>
<br>During Sixer-in-council with the Akelas, Sixers and Assistant Sixers are
given time to discuss issues that arise during the activities, and areas
for improvement. Problem-solving, resilience, teamwork and initiative are
examples of the discussion focus.</p>

<p>Empowering leaders and talents</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Small group leadership are provided to all Cub Scouts where they are organized
into Six, each led by a Sixer, supported by an Assistant Sixer. Sixer and
Assistant Sixers are to plan games and organise lessons for the members
in their Six. These roles mimic real-world responsibilities and give students
a chance to organize projects, speak in front of others and collaborate
with peers and adult leaders.
<br>
<br>Cubs who display leadership and responsibility are selected to attend
Area and National Camps. After which, they will be appointed as Sixers
and Assistant Sixers to lead a pack of 6.</p>
