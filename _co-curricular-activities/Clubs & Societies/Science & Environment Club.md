<p>Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character
building and inculcating the values of team spirit, empathy and self-discipline.
<br>Group activities form an integral part of the CCA. Members find meaning
through interactions with the other members and their interdependence on
one other to achieve a set task.
<br>Members are trained to be self-disciplined to complete their tasks, with
the help of the other members.</p>
