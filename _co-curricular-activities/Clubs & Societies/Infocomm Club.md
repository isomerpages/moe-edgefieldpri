<p>Infocomm CCA is designed for students who have no prior experience in
programming. The program incorporates games, microprocessors, programmable
robots, and artifact creation to simulate real-world IT development in
a hackathon-style format using provided resources. Students will also engage
in project work, encouraging them to think creatively, collaborate effectively,
and take initiative.</p>
