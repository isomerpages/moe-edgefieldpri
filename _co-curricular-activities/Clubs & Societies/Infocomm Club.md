<p>Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character
building and inculcating the values of team spirit, integrity and empathy.
<br>The ability to code computer programs is an important part of literacy
in today’s society. When people learn to code in SCRATCH, they learn important
strategies for solving problems, designing projects and communicating ideas.
CCA members work collaboratively as a team to imagine and create these
ideas to become reality online.
<br>CCA members also work closely with the Cyberwellness and AVA teams to
gain more experiences and insights with the digital world.</p>
