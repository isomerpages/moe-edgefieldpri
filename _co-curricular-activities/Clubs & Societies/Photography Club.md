    <th class="tg-539o">Photography Club aims to nurture students to develop keen observation skills of their space and environment, using photography as a medium to tell their story and communicate their ideas. The CCA sessions are based on each child’s talent level, with Intermediate Photography class on Tuesdays, 2.00 – 3.30pm and Basic Photography class on Fridays, 2.00 – 3.30pm. Students are given opportunities to take photos in studio settings, outdoors within the school vicinity and during planned learning journeys in different parts of Singapore.<br></th>
