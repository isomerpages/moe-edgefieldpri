<p>Experiences</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>CCA members get to experience creating art in different art forms during
the year. Members get the opportunity to go on learning journeys to art
museums or art exhibitions. These learning journeys expose them to a variety
of different art movements or styles. These allow them to develop a better
sense of aesthetics.</p>

</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>During CCA sessions, members are empowered by not only learning the skills
but also working together in teams to conceptualise the actualisation of
the art work.
<br>Members also learn various fine arts skills such as painting, doodling
and experimenting with different media.</p>

<p>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character
building and inculcating the values of perseverance and determination to
produce and complete quality art work.
<br>Problem solving tasks which require the students to determine the different
art mediums allow them, by trial and error, to come up with a creative
solution. These also instil positive life skills such as time management,
responsibility and decision making.</p>

<p>Empowering leaders and talents</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Art Club seniors lead and help the juniors in the overall housekeeping
of the materials and hand hold them in some activities. This provides the
opportunity to hone their leadership skills and instil a sense of pride
in them as they are respected by their fellow juniors.</p>
