<p>About Dancesport</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Dancesport is a powerful mix of sport, art, and connection. As a form
of competitive ballroom dancing, it blends social skills with athletic
movement, making it both fun and challenging. Dancers need strength, agility,
coordination, and stamina, along with grace, discipline, and style.
<br>
<br>At the heart of Dancesport are two powerful values: <strong>resilience</strong> and <strong>unity</strong>.
Our dancers train hard and never give up embodying the spirit of resilience.
As Dancesport is all about partnership, dancers must move as one, building
trust and supporting each other every step of the way in unity.
<br>
<br>These values turn Dancesport into more than just a competition. It becomes
a vibrant display of teamwork, strength, and determination, all flowing
with the rhythm of the music.
<br>
<br>Get ready to dance every Tuesday during our CCA sessions! Training takes
place in the dance studios, where your child will learn from friendly and
experienced dance instructors. It is the perfect chance to have fun, improve
your moves, and grow your confidence.</p>

<p>Students will dive into the exciting world of dance by learning two dynamic
styles – the lively Cha Cha and the energetic Jive. As they progress to
higher talent levels, the choreography becomes more intricate, challenging
them to refine their technique and express themselves with greater flair.
<br>
<br>Dancesports members do not just train – they <strong>shine</strong>. From
school showcases to external performances, they will have plenty of chances
to take the stage, gain confidence, and share their passion for dance with
diverse audiences leaving them with unforgettable experiences that bring
their hard work to life.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>During CCA sessions, members build a strong sense of self-worth and grow
increasingly confident in their ability to perform on stage and compete.
They learn to embrace public performances with a positive mindset, turning
nerves into excitement. Beyond the dance floor, social graciousness is
nurtured as members are guided to carry themselves with poise and respect
- embodying the qualities of true ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Training sessions go beyond perfecting dance steps—they are designed to
shape character and nurture well-rounded individuals. Through every practice,
members are encouraged to uphold values such as <strong>integrity</strong>, <strong>gratitude</strong>,
and <strong>discipline</strong>, while embracing <strong>team spirit</strong>, <strong>respect</strong>,
and <strong>loyalty</strong>. They learn that true strength lies not only
in skill, but in <strong>courage</strong>, <strong>empathy</strong>, and <strong>unity</strong>—standing
by one another through both triumphs and trials.
<br>
<br>Debrief sessions offer a safe space for reflection, where members discuss
challenges faced, lessons learned, and how they have grown. Themes such
as <strong>resilience</strong>, <strong>respect</strong>, and <strong>responsibility</strong> are
explored, helping dancers build not just physical endurance, but the emotional
strength and moral compass to succeed in dance and in life.</p>
