<p>About
<br>Malay Dance</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Malay Dance CCA offers students a vibrant platform to explore and
express the rich cultural heritage of the Malay community through traditional
and contemporary dance. It is a celebration of rhythm, grace, and storytelling
through movement.
<br>
<br>The CCA aims to nurture a deeper appreciation of Malay culture and the
performing arts among students. Through structured training and performance
opportunities, students develop confidence, discipline, teamwork, and creativity.
The CCA also encourages cultural pride and promotes inclusivity through
multicultural exposure and collaboration.
<br>
<br>Malay Dance has been part of our school’s CCA offerings, and has grown
from a small group to a passionate team that participates in school events,
national celebrations, and inter-school competitions such as the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF). One unique aspect of Malay Dance is the use of expressive
hand movements and intricate footwork that tell stories drawn from nature,
history, and daily life.
<br>
<br>Malay Dance CCA is open to all P3 to P6 students, regardless of race or
gender, who have an interest in dance, culture, and performing arts. No
prior experience is required—just a willingness to learn and a positive
attitude!</p>

<p>Developing our students</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Through Malay Dance CCA, students acquire a wide range of skills and values
that go beyond dance. They develop coordination, rhythm, spatial awareness,
and performance techniques, while also learning the importance of discipline,
perseverance, and respect for culture.
<br>
<br>The CCA provides a nurturing environment where students grow in confidence
and resilience as they rehearse and perform in front of various audiences.
Regular practices and stage experiences help students overcome stage fright,
express themselves more freely, and communicate effectively through movement
and teamwork.
<br>
<br>Students also learn the value of teamwork and collaboration, as dance
routines require synchronization, trust, and mutual support. Working closely
with their peers, they develop a strong sense of camaraderie and shared
responsibility, which contributes to their overall personal and social
growth.</p>

<br>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Malay Dance CCA supports the holistic development of students by nurturing
both character and compassion. As students rehearse and perform together,
they take on responsibilities, show empathy towards one another, and contribute
meaningfully to the school community.
<br>In the words of cultural icon Som Said, <em>“Dance is not just movement. It is the expression of our identity, our culture, and our soul.”</em>
<br>This belief is reflected in the CCA’s emphasis on values education, where
students learn and practise the school values of integrity, gratitude,
resilience, empathy, and unity, growing into confident and culturally rooted
individuals.</p>

<p>Empowering leaders and talents</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>As part of our efforts to cultivate leadership qualities among our students,
key leadership roles such as Chairman and Vice-Chairman are appointed to
oversee the management of CCA sessions and to assist in maintaining discipline.
In addition, group leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of guiding
and supporting their peers during dance practices. Senior members also
take turns leading warm-up routines. These structured leadership opportunities
allow students to develop confidence, responsibility, and collaborative
skills, while fostering a strong sense of ownership and commitment within
the CCA.</p>
