<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Malay Dance CCA offers students a vibrant platform to explore and
express the rich cultural heritage of the Malay community through traditional
and contemporary dance. It is a celebration of rhythm, grace, and storytelling
through movement.
<br>
<br>The CCA aims to nurture a deeper appreciation of Malay culture and the
performing arts among students. Through structured training and performance
opportunities, students develop confidence, discipline, teamwork, and creativity.
The CCA also encourages cultural pride and promotes inclusivity through
multicultural exposure and collaboration.
<br>
<br>Malay Dance has been part of our school’s CCA offerings, and has grown
from a small group to a passionate team that participates in school events,
national celebrations, and inter-school competitions such as the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF). One unique aspect of Malay Dance is the use of expressive
hand movements and intricate footwork that tell stories drawn from nature,
history, and daily life.
<br>
<br>Malay Dance CCA is open to all P3 to P6 students, regardless of race or
gender, who have an interest in dance, culture, and performing arts. No
prior experience is required—just a willingness to learn and a positive
attitude!</p>
