    <th class="tg-dafn">About Choir</th>
    <th class="tg-u05r">Our Choir aims to provide a platform for students who have passion for singing to learn different genres of music and sing well with confidence while performing.<br>The CCA sessions are mainly on Fridays, 2.00pm – 4.00pm. Activities are mostly held in the school’s music room. Others include exchange programmes with other school choirs, as well as concerts or musical appreciations.<br>Now, Choir has taken another approach in engaging our members due to the pandemic. We have included online lessons, quizzes, bonding games, song composing and mini performances to allow members to continue to explore and hone their skills in different aspects of music.</th>

    <td class="tg-dafn">Experiences</td>
    <td class="tg-u05r">By the end of each year, CCA members would have acquired:<br>1.   Knowledge of musical background (i.e. Learning to read musical scores)<br>2.   Vocal techniques (i.e. Intonation, Breathing techniques, Harmonisation, Expression in singing) <br>Annually, our members get to perform on various events (i.e. SYF, ABRSM, Aesthetics Night, Speech and Prize-Giving Day etc). Our pupils participate in school exchanges and attend musical performances to increase their musical knowledge through collaborative experiences. We also have our annual Choir Camp to facilitate peer bonding and enhance their choral singing. Members also get the opportunity to hone their love for singing by performing their favourite songs as a group during our in-house End-of-year concert cum farewell for the Primary 6 members. Singing performances are currently not allowed during this pandemic situation. Hence, we provide a fresh experience with song-composing using online applications for our members and give them platforms to showcase and improve on their own talents individually.</td>

    <td class="tg-dafn">Developing our students</td>
    <td class="tg-u05r">During CCA sessions, members will learn warm-up techniques to prepare for choral singing. Choral pieces are chosen by the choir conductor for practice, and they can come in different languages such as Japanese or Bahasa Indonesia. Members will learn pronunciation and vocal techniques required to sing the choral pieces well. Overall, all choir members will learn how to perform a choral piece well as one collective voice. We also allow each member to showcase a talent and give them individual guidance to improve.<br><br></td>

    <td class="tg-dafn">Growing hearts and minds</td>
    <td class="tg-u05r">Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character building and inculcating the values of team spirit, self-discipline and empathy.<br>Members are also given the empowerment to suggest what they would like to do. These opportunities are given to encourage pro-activeness, creativity and exploration of personal strengths.<br>Reflections are conducted at the end of CCA so that each pupil are given time to think about what they have learnt or achieve together as a choir. It is also a time for pupils to address any matters related to the choir.<br></td>

    <td class="tg-u05r">Potential P4 and 5 choir student leaders are trained during the annual choir camp held in June. The selected student leaders will then help out to oversee the discipline and order of the choir during practices. These experiences provide them the opportunity to hone their leadership skills.<br><br></td>
