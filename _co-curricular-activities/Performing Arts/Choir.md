<p>About Choir</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Choir is a vibrant co-curricular activity that nurtures students’ love
for music and singing. Through voice training and choral singing, students
develop a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and confidence. Open to
all students with a passion for singing, Choir welcomes both beginners
and experienced vocalists.
<br>
<br>The CCA aims to cultivate vocal excellence, musical appreciation, and
performance confidence. Students learn to express themselves artistically
while developing core values such as integrity in practice, gratitude for
each opportunity, unity in harmonising as one voice, and empathy through
the emotional depth of music.</p>
