<p>About Choir</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Our choir aims to provide a platform for students who have passion for
singing to learn different genres of music and sing well with confidence
while performing.
<br>The CCA sessions are mainly on Fridays, 2.15pm – 4.15pm. Activities are
mostly held in the school’s music room. Other activities include exchange
programmes with other school choirs or musical appreciations.</p>

<p>Experiences</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>By the end of each year, CCA members will acquire:
<br>1. Knowledge of musical background (i.e. learning to read musical scores)
<br>2. Vocal techniques (i.e. Intonation, Breathing techniques, Harmonisation,
expression in singing)
<br>Annually, our members get to perform on various events (i.e. SYF, ABRSM,
Aesthetics Night, Speech and Prize-Giving Day etc). Our pupils participate
in school exchanges and attend musical performances to increase their musical
knowledge through collaborative experiences. We have our annual Choir Camp
to facilitate peer bonding and enhance their choral singing. Members also
get the opportunity to hone their love for singing by performing their
favourite songs as a group during our in-house End-of-year concert cum
farewell for the Primary 6 members.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>During CCA sessions, members will learn warm-up techniques to prepare
for choral singing. Choral pieces are chosen by the choir conductor for
practice, and they can come in different languages such as Japanese or
Bahasa Indonesia. Members will learn pronunciation and vocal techniques
required to sing the choral pieces well. Overall, all choir members will
learn how to perform a choral piece well as one collective voice. We also
allow each member to showcase a talent and give them individual guidance
to improve.</p>

<p>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character
building and inculcating the values of team spirit, self-discipline and
empathy.
<br>Members are also given the empowerment to suggest what they would like
to do. These opportunities are given to encourage pro-activeness, creativity
and exploration of personal strengths.
<br>Reflections are conducted at the end of CCA so that each pupil are given
time to think about what they have learnt or achieve together as a choir.
It is also a time for pupils to address any matters related to the choir.

<p>Potential P4 and 5 choir student leaders are trained during the annual
choir camp held in June. The selected student leaders will then help out
to oversee the discipline and order of the choir during practices. These
experiences provide them the opportunity to hone their leadership skills.</p>
