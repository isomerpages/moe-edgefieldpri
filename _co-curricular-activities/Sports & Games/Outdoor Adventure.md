<p>CCA members go through 4 modules during the year:
<br>1. Navigation
<br>2. Camp Crafts
<br>3. Environmental Awareness and Appreciation
<br>4. Adventure Challenges
<br>Members get the opportunity to go on a learning journey at least once
per semester. These learning journeys include local hikes to the nature
reserve, navigation field trips to the parks as well as high ropes challenges
at local adventure challenge venues. They further hone their love for the
outdoors by getting to know more about Singapore’s flora and fauna during
these learning journeys.</p>

like shelter-building and outdoor cooking. Practical navigational skills
such as using Google maps as a way finding tool is taught.
<br>Members also learn basic belaying skills when they go through the sport
climbing sessions at our school’s rock climbing wall.
<br>Risk management and trail etiquette are part of the skill set taught as
the members go through the 4 modules.</p>

<p>Activities conducted during the CCA sessions are geared towards character
building and inculcating the values of team spirit, integrity and empathy.
<br>Team building activities form an integral part of the CCA as members find
meaning through interactions with the other members and their interdependence
on each other to achieve a set task.
<br>During debriefing time conducted at the end of each activity or CCA session,
members are given the opportunity to discuss about issues that arise during
the activities. Problem-solving, resilience, gratitude and empathy are
examples of the debrief focus.</p>
