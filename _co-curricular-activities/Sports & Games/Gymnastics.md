<p><strong>Introduction to the Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)</strong>
<br>The Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) offers students a dynamic
and enriching platform to develop their physical abilities, mental discipline,
and core values through the sport of gymnastics. This CCA integrates elements
of movement, coordination, strength, flexibility, and performance.
<br>
<br><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>
<br>The primary purpose of the Gymnastics CCA is to nurture students' physical
fitness and motor skills while instilling important life values such as
resilience, unity, and responsibility.
<br>
<br>The objectives of the programme are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop fundamental gymnastics skills in a progressive and supportive
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build character through perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to participate in performances, competitions,
and collaborative events.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gymnastics CCA is open to all students from Primary 3 to Primary 6,
regardless of gender. It is well-suited for students who enjoy physical
activity, have an interest in acrobatics or movement-based sports. No prior
experience is requiredâ€”only a positive attitude, a willingness to learn,
and a commitment to personal growth.</p>
