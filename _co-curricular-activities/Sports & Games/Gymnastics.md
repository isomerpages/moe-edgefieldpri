<p><strong>Introduction to the Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)</strong>
<br>The Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) offers students a dynamic
and enriching platform to develop their physical abilities, mental discipline,
and core values through the sport of gymnastics. This CCA integrates elements
of movement, coordination, strength, flexibility, and performance.
<br>
<br><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>
<br>The primary purpose of the Gymnastics CCA is to nurture students' physical
fitness and motor skills while instilling important life values such as
resilience, unity, and responsibility.
<br>
<br>The objectives of the programme are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop fundamental gymnastics skills in a progressive and supportive
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build character through perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to participate in performances, competitions,
and collaborative events.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gymnastics CCA is open to all students from Primary 3 to Primary 6,
regardless of gender. It is well-suited for students who enjoy physical
activity, have an interest in acrobatics or movement-based sports. No prior
experience is required—only a positive attitude, a willingness to learn,
and a commitment to personal growth.</p>

<p>Developing our students</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Participation in the Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) provides
students with a holistic learning experience that extends beyond physical
development.
<br>
<br>Students gain <strong>confidence</strong> as they master new skills and
perform in front of peers, teachers, and external audiences. Overcoming
challenges and striving for improvement in a physically demanding sport
also fosters <strong>resilience</strong>, teaching students to persevere
through setbacks and continue working towards their goals.
<br>
<br>The nature of the CCA also provides numerous <strong>opportunities for teamwork and collaboration</strong>.
Whether practising routines, preparing for performances, or participating
in group events, students learn to support one another, build trust, and
coordinate effectively as a team.</p>

<p>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Gymnastics Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is committed to supporting
the holistic development of students by fostering both physical excellence
and strong character. Through structured training, collaborative activities,
and meaningful learning experiences, students are guided to grow into confident,
responsible, and values-driven individuals.
<br>
<br>Character development is a central component of the CCA. Students learn
the importance of <strong>service </strong>by contributing to school events
and mentoring their juniors, demonstrating a willingness to give back to
the community. They develop <strong>responsibility</strong> by taking ownership
of their personal progress, attending training punctually, and demonstrating
commitment to their team. <strong>Empathy</strong> is cultivated through
peer support and encouragement, as students work together to overcome challenges
and celebrate each other's successes.
<br>
<br>The CCA also strongly emphasises the school’s core values of <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>resilience</strong>.
Unity is fostered through team-based activities that require collaboration,
mutual respect, and a shared sense of purpose. Students learn to trust
and support one another, recognising the strength that comes from working
together towards common goals. Resilience is instilled as students face
and overcome physical and mental challenges in training and competition,
developing perseverance and a positive mindset in the face of setbacks.</p>

</td>

<p>Beyond honing technical skills, the CCA nurtures holistic growth by providing
multiple avenues for student leadership, performance, and peer engagement.
<br>
<br>Students are encouraged to take on leadership roles such as CCA leaders.
These roles allow them to develop organisational and communication skills
as they guide peers.
<br>
<br>Members have various opportunities to showcase their talents through school-based
performances and national competitions. These platforms not only celebrate
their hard work and progress but also build confidence and team spirit.
<br>
<br>The CCA emphasizes a strong mentorship culture, where experienced gymnasts
