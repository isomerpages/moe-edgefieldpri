    <th class="tg-dafn">About Netball</th>
    <th class="tg-u05r">Netball is an all-girls sport that is played by two teams. Teams may include up to 12 players but only 7 may take the court at any one time. Each player will take on a position on court. A game consists of 4 x 10 minutes quarters with an interval of 3 minutes after the first and third quarters and a 5-minute half-time interval. The major aim of the game is to score as many goals as possible from within the Goal Circle. The CCA sessions are on Fridays (competition period), 2.00 â€“ 4.00pm. Trainings are conducted in the indoor sports hall.</th>
