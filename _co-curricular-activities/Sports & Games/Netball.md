<p>About Netball</p>
</th>
<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Netball is an all-girls sport that is played by two teams. Teams may include
up to 12 players but only 7 may take the court at any one time. Each player
will take on a position on court. A game consists of 4 x 10 minutes quarters
with an interval of 3 minutes after the first and third quarters and a
5-minute half-time interval. The major aim of the game is to score as many
goals as possible from within the Goal Circle. The CCA sessions are on
Fridays (competition period), 2.00 â€“ 4.00pm. Trainings are conducted in
the indoor sports hall.</p>
