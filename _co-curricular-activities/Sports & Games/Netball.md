<p>About Netball</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Netball is a vibrant and dynamic CCA offered at Edgefield Primary School,
designed to develop students holistically—physically, emotionally, and
mentally. Through structured training and team experiences, the CCA aims
to instill discipline, build confidence, and nurture responsible decision-making
in students.
<br>
<br>Introduced in EFPS in 2019, the netball CCA began its competitive journey
in 2023, marking an exciting milestone in its development. Netball is open
to girls who enjoy being active and are ready to embrace the physical intensity
of the sport. Whether they are new to the game or have prior experience,
students with a passion for movement and a team-oriented mindset will find
netball a rewarding and empowering CCA experience.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At Edgefield Primary School, netballers are given a wide range of enriching
experiences that support both their sporting and personal growth. They
participate in a variety of enriching activities and events, including
regular training sessions to build fundamental skills, fitness, discipline
and teamwork. Netballers also have specialized workshops that focus on
techniques, strategy, and sportsmanship.

other schools further enhance their gameplay and sportsmanship. Unique
experiences include opportunities to represent the school, go on learning
journeys such as visits to professional matches or training academies.
<br>
<br>Beyond competition, unique opportunities such as participating in the
Netball Carnivals and the Zonal 12 &amp; Under Carnival provide a platform
for students to challenge themselves and interact with peers from other
schools. The annual parent-child carnival also strengthens family bonds,
fostering mutual support and shared pride in the students' CCA journey.</p>

<p>Developing our students</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Playing netball provides students with rich opportunities for personal
growth and character development, aligning closely with Singapore’s 21st
Century Competencies (21CC). Through regular training and competition,
students build confidence as they hone their physical abilities and learn
to perform under pressure. The nature of the game demands resilience and
discipline—qualities developed through setbacks, consistent practice, and
strategic play. Just as importantly, netball emphasizes teamwork and communication,
helping students strengthen interpersonal skills and foster a sense of
responsibility to one another.</p>

<p>Growing hearts and minds</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Netball as a CCA nurtures both the hearts and minds of students, supporting
their holistic development beyond the court. Through team roles and leadership
opportunities, players learn the importance of service and giving back.
Whether mentoring juniors or organizing events, netballers grow in empathy
and develop a strong sense of social responsibility. These experiences
foster character and emotional intelligence, key components of holistic
education. As students navigate wins and losses together, they build not
only sporting skills but also compassion, integrity, and the mindset to
lead with care—embodying the true spirit of growing hearts and minds.</p>
