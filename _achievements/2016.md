### Singapore Green Awards 2016

The SEC-StarHub School Green Awards (SGA) is a self-audited voluntary environmental programme which serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase their environmental efforts, through customised activities which will help them gain better understanding of the environment. In 2016, heavier emphasis is being placed on the role of advocacy by students, with the incorporation of the community environmental outreach component. 

We are proud to announce that Edgefield Primary has achieved the top level Lotus Award for 2016!

Be the change you want to see!

### Primary School Debate Open 2016

Over the past five weeks, 30 primary schools from all over Singapore competed at the Primary School Debate Open (PSDO) hosted by Methodist Girls’ School (Primary), and supported by Debate Association (Singapore). This national primary school tournament provided opportunities for primary school debaters to gain confidence in communicating their rational arguments and making connections when presenting their compelling research and evidence. The debaters also had to work collaboratively to support and build on the points of their teammates.

On 17 September 2016, our debate team, made up of Lin Zong Kai (5 Patience), Yashika Verma (5 Patience), Divya Kathiravan (5 Patience), Aisyah Humairah (5 Love) and Aditi Nair (5 Love), participated in the Grand Final. After an exciting final round, Edgefield Primary School emerged as champions (Division 2). Yashika Verma was also voted best speaker for the finals. Individual speakers were scored for each of the three preliminary rounds and the top five speakers were given the overall Good Speaker Award. We would like to congratulate Lin Zong Kai and Yashika Verma, who have done well and are the recipients of the overall Good Speaker Award.

#### Well done Team Edgefield, you have done us proud!
