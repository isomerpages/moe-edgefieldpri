### Primary School Debate Open 2017 

The Primary School Debate Open (PSDO) was organized by Debate Association (Singapore), in collaboration with Methodist Girls’ School (Primary). More than 40 primary schools from all over Singapore competed in this national primary school tournament.

After a victorious season in the debate scene last year, emerging as proud champions of Division 2, Edgefield Primary was promoted to Division 1. Our students enthusiastically tackled a tougher playing field this year, scaling through the three intense preliminary rounds and semi-finals. On 18 September 2017, our debate team, made up of Nitya Kolla (5 Grace), Neha Kumar (5 Grace),

Nandita Joshi (5 Faith), Samuel Tan (5 Grace) and Charlotte Tan (4 Wisdom), competed in the Grand Finals of the PSDO. Opposing the motion ‘This House would ban animal testing’, the team sparred against opponents Temasek Primary School, honing their skills as they presented rational arguments with confidence and posed challenges to their opponents with their quick retorts. After a gruelling round against Temasek Primary School, Edgefield Primary School has emerged as champions!
