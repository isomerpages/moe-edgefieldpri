### Chinese Dance Fiesta

Our Chinese Dance performed a dance titled "Water Lotus" at the Chinese Dance Fiesta at Toa Payoh Central Amphitheatre on 8 June 2019 (Saturday). This dance arrangement resembles the movement of lotus flowers and leaves swaying with the wind, signifying the vitality of the lotus plant.Â 

Students practised hard for the performance and with the help of their teachers and parents, spent the Saturday performing for the audience and viewing other Chinese Dance performances.
