### Chinese Dance Fiesta

Our Chinese Dance performed a dance titled "Water Lotus" at the Chinese Dance Fiesta at Toa Payoh Central Amphitheatre on 8 June 2019 (Saturday). This dance arrangement resembles the movement of lotus flowers and leaves swaying with the wind, signifying the vitality of the lotus plant. 

Students practised hard for the performance and with the help of their teachers and parents, spent the Saturday performing for the audience and viewing other Chinese Dance performances.

### FOOTBALL - NORTH ZONE Top 4

The football CCA Junior Team (P4&5), clinched the 4th  position in the North Zone in the 2019 SPSSC Annual Zonal Championship. It was a truly exciting journey as we managed to get 2nd place in the first round to qualify for the quarter finals. 

At the quarter finals, we fought hard till the end and managed to score the all-important goal with only 2 minutes remaining to bring us to the semi-finals.

At the semi-final match, our P5 student Ahmad Martin was awarded the player of the match award.

As the top 4 teams in the zone, we also got to participate in the Nationals to play against the top teams in the other zone.  

We can proudly celebrate our juniors for making it to the top 16 teams in Singapore.
