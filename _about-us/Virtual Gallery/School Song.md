<p>Edgefield Primary is our choice
<br>Let’s proclaim it with one voice
<br>Standing tall above it all
<br>We’re united in one accord</p>
<p>Endeavour, endeavour to excel
<br>Striving towards a future bright
<br>Forward and onward we will go
<br>Together we’ll build a world of hope</p>
<p>Respect, compassion and loyalty
<br>For families, friends and community
<br>Making a difference touching lives
<br>By these values, we will abide.</p>
<p>Endeavour, endeavour to excel
<br>Striving towards a future bright
<br>Forward and onward we will go
<br>Together, we’ll build
<br>a world of hope.&nbsp;
<br>Edgefield Primary, where our hearts belong</p>
