Edgefield Primary is our choice <br>
Let’s proclaim it with one voice <br>
Standing tall above it all <br>
We’re united in one accord

Endeavour, endeavour to excel<br>
Striving towards a future bright<br>
Forward and onward we will go<br>
Together we’ll build a world of hope

Respect, compassion and loyalty<br>
For families, friends and community<br>
Making a difference touching lives<br>
By these values, we will abide.

Endeavour, endeavour to excel<br>
Striving towards a future bright<br>
Forward and onward we will go<br>
Together, we’ll build<br>
a world of hope. <br>
Edgefield Primary, where our hearts belong
