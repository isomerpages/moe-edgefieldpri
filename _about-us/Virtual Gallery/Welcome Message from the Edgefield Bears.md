"Hello everyone! Welcome to Edgefield Primary School! I am Eddie and this is my classmate, Gennie! We are the Edgefield Bears!  

We were born on 17 July 2011 in time for Edgefield Primary's 10th Anniversary. Concurrently, our students don the new school uniform that year.  Gennie and I had the honour to be among the first few Edgefielders to don the uniform. We were so excited as the new uniform was trendy, sporty and it immediately won the hearts of all our stakeholders. The polo tee shirt was made from breathable fabric which can absorb sweat. Thus, it kept us cool throughout the day.

To introduce the new uniform to the whole school, we made our appearance at one of the school assemblies. The students were very elated to meet us. They were also invited to suggest a name for each of us. The names, "Eddie" and "Gennie" were eventually chosen. Each of our names starts with the first two letters namely 'ED' and 'GE'. String together, they form the word 'EDGE'. 

Gennie and I are very proud to be Edgefield Bears. Through the years, we have witnessed the growth of the school. Come 2021, we will be 10 years old and at the same time, we will be celebrating the school's 20th birthday! 

We wish you all the best. 

Once an Edgefielder, always an Edgefielder ! "
