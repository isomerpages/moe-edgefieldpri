<h3>Welcome to Edgefield Primary School</h3>
<p>Happy New Year to everyone.&nbsp; I would like to warmly welcome everyone
back to school in 2025 and especially our Primary 1 students who have joined
us this year.&nbsp; It is certainly going to be a very remarkable year
with new Mission/Values/Motto, new approaches, new programs, new places
and new experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In keeping up with the changing education landscape, the school
staff have come together to craft our new Mission; Whereby every Edgefielder
will:
<br>
</p>
<p>#Develop Positive Relationships</p>
<p>#Be an Active Learner</p>
<p>#Make Meaningful Contributions</p>
<p>#Embrace Artful Living</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our new school motto is, ‘<strong><em>Believe to see the best version of me’.</em></strong> Indeed,
we are deeply committed to helping every student discover and become the
best version of himself/herself. This journey of growth goes beyond academics;
It extends to the way they help one another, handle setbacks, reflect on
their learning experiences and grow as a whole person holistically. This
relates well to what our Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized to
students at an education merit awards ceremony in his constituency. He
urged them to “<em>focus on not just their studies, but also their all-round growth, and become individuals who can uplift others and deal with challenges themselves”</em> (The
Straits Times, 19 May 2024). It is also important for our students to know
that being the best version of themselves is not about perfection, but
about striving to improve daily, learning from their mistakes and others
around them. It is also about reflecting how much they can impact others
in the school community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The highlight for this year will be the start of our <strong>E.D.G.E Signature Programme</strong>.
The acronym E.D.G.E stands for <strong>Experience. Develop. Grow and Empower</strong>.
The E.D.G.E programme is designed for every student to embody the school
motto by realizing his/her talents and interests and pursuing them with
commitment. It aims to nurture our students in their 21st Century Competencies
and become self-directed individuals with a clearer sense of Identity.</p>
<p>Over six years, our students will engage in a variety of learning activities
across 22 modules in 6 domains which are Performing Arts, Language Arts,
Digital/Visual Literacy, Lifestyle, STEM, and Sports. The learning activities
are designed to spark curiosity, uncover talents, and nurture passions.
This diverse learning supports holistic development and helps students
discover their strengths and interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Edgefield Primary School, we believe that every student should
feel valued, heard, and empowered. For example, we gave students the opportunity
to vote for the name of our newly created student hangout. In 2025, we
will provide our students with more opportunities to exercise Choice and
Voice, while teaching them the values of discernment, tact and respect.
This will allow them to become confident individuals who are also empathetic
and responsible.</p>
<p>As the late Mr Lee Kwan Yew has said, “If you want to reach your goals
and dreams, you cannot do it without discipline,” we will place premium
importance in building the character and values of our students so that
they are developed appropriately in the social and moral domains as well.&nbsp;
Opportunities will be provided for all students to be educated in civic
literacy and exemplify the values taught so that they will develop into
cultured and gracious individuals and citizens.&nbsp; This year, the school
has developed our very own IGRUE (based on school values: Integrity, Gratitude,
Resilience, Unity and Empathy) Edgefield characters who will be used to
educate our students’ thoughts, values and habits.&nbsp; Each day will
begin with sharing anecdotes and current affairs stories centering on our
school values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our school will use the power of <strong>WE</strong> in engaging all
staff and students at the level/school so that we can work and learn collaboratively
and level up everyone synergistically.&nbsp; To enable our students to
be more self-directed, the school has created spaces like <strong>The Secret Garden, Theatre of Hope and Haven@EDGE</strong>,
where students are given opportunities to be more proactive in their learning
during their free time.&nbsp; The school will also provide varied platforms
for students to showcase their talents and share their eventful moments
at various junctures with their peers so that they can be a good influence
on one another at the level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To teach well, we will learn well. Hence, through staff collaboration
and capacity building, we will develop subject mastery and competency in
every staff so that we can teach effectively to enable better student engagement
to realise the learning outcomes. All learning activities and lessons will
be planned collaboratively so that every student benefits optimally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We need everyone’s contribution, engagement and support to realize
our dreams for our students and for the school.&nbsp; We seek parents’
support and partnership to help us in our journey so that we continue to
be a school of choice that prepares our students for the future.&nbsp;
Thus far, our parents have been so encouraging and supportive of our school’s
programmes and process and have lent their help as well. Let’s continue
this trusting relationship and Believe to See that we can bring Edgefield
Primary to the next level of schooling.</p>
