<h2>Welcome to Edgefield Primary School</h2>
<p></p>
<img src="/images/Mdm_Rabiathul_Bazriya.jpg" style="width:55%">
<p>Happy New Year to everyone.&nbsp; I would like to warmly welcome everyone
back to school in 2024 and especially our Primary 1 students who have joined
us this year.&nbsp; It is certainly a new beginning for me as the Principal
of Edgefield Primary School in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under my predecessor and previous Principals, Edgefield Primary has grown
and become a school of choice in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; I would like
to leverage the current strengths of the school and continue to equip our
students intentionally with the 21st century competencies(21CC). The school’s
current focus on leveraging the Arts, Innovation and technology in building
the confidence and self-esteem of the students resonates very much with
my beliefs as well.&nbsp; We will continue to create varied platforms and
opportunities for every student to showcase their talents and interests
purposefully.&nbsp; We will provide a varied and enriching differentiated
curriculum for the students in both the academic and non-academic areas
to stretch them cognitively, aesthetically, and physically. In alignment
with the school’s Vision of <strong><em>Lives Empowered, Lives Touched</em></strong>,
we will intentionally provide students with more Choice and Voice both
in and out of classroom experiences, so that they can be better engaged
and stretched.&nbsp; At the same time, we will provide the necessary scaffolds
and support structures for students who need the extra help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Innovation Programme will continue to provide students with the skills
and competencies to hone their inventive thinking which is an extremely
important skill in today’s world. As Minister Chan Chun Sing always emphasises
that students cannot “.learn yesterday’s solutions to solve today’s challenges”.
Instead, we should be “…nurturing their passions, interests and ingenuity
to help them uncover tomorrow’s solutions for the challenges of the future.”&nbsp;
Hence, the school will work on how we can develop this inventive and reflective
thinking as part of our everyday learning.</p>
<p>As the late Mr Lee Kwan Yew has said, “If you want to reach your goals
and dreams, you cannot do it without discipline,” we will place premium
importance in building the character and values of our students so that
they are developed appropriately in the social and moral domains as well.&nbsp;
Opportunities will be provided for all students to be educated in civic
literacy and exemplify the values taught so that they will develop into
cultured and gracious individuals and citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school will use the power of <strong>WE</strong> in engaging all staff
and students at the level/school so that we can work and learn collaboratively
and level up everyone synergistically.&nbsp; The school’s theme will be <strong>BELIEVE to See</strong>.&nbsp;
This is a paradigm shift to what traditionally we know of where We See
to Believe.&nbsp; I will provide more information on this approach in my
subsequent communication.</p>
<p>To teach well, we will learn well. Hence, through staff collaboration
and capacity building we will develop Subject mastery and competency in
every staff so that we can teach effectively to enable better students
engagement to realise the learning outcomes.</p>
<p>We need everyone’s contribution, engagement and support to realize our
dreams for our students and for the school.&nbsp; We seek parents’ support
and partnership to help us in our journey so that we continue to be a school
of choice that is relevant to times.&nbsp; Let’s Believe to See that we
can bring Edgefield Primary to the next level of schooling.</p>
