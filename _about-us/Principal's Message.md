Welcome to Edgefield Primary School
-------------------------------------------------

It is my privilege to welcome you to a new year at EFPS. We are one of the first educational institutions established in the heart of Punggol. With a history of 20 years, we are known for the vibrancy of our forward-looking curriculum that empowers and nurtures the students for a better Singapore.  

Our school vision, Lives Empowered, Lives Touched, reflects what the school prides itself on. We believe in developing our students to be future ready as they lead, serve and make a difference to the lives of people, leaving a positive impact on others. In the six years that they are with us, we provide a holistic education with the schoolâ€™s positive affirming culture and inviting environment. We endeavour to inspire our students to discover their own unique strengths, to enjoy learning and grow in confidence.

Anchored in strong values, our signature programmes add to the vibrancy of our curriculum. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Environmental Science and Sustainability Programme, is in line with the national sustainability agenda under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. We aim to nurture our students as stewards of the environment and do our part to build a sustainable future. Our Learn for Life Programme (LLP), Dancesports, reflects our core values of&nbsp;**self-discipline**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**team spirit**. It teaches our students that true partnership builds on communication and understanding, and there is simply no room for selfishness. We continue to focus on photography which inspires our students to see and understand the world through different lens. As they tell their own stories through the photographs they take, our students develop greater&nbsp;**empathy**&nbsp;for others. Our latest programme, Makerspace, aims to develop 21st&nbsp;century competencies such as critical, creative and inventive thinking in our students. We believe in empowering our students to be the solutions to real-world problems.&nbsp;

All said, the future brims with bright possibilities and challenges. As we move into a new year, let us take this opportunity to reflect, learn and grow as a team. The theme for 2022-2023 is&nbsp;**Cherish, Nourish, Flourish**. We cherish the past and the present. We are grateful to all those who have touched our lives and will continue to be more inclusive and empathetic towards others. As we grow and develop, we also want to take the right actions to strengthen ourselves physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually. We think about what we feed into our stomachs, our minds and our lives. With the nourishment and care that we collectively provide, learning will become more meaningful. We believe every Edgefielder will flourish and are empowered to shape their future today.

Endeavour to excel!
