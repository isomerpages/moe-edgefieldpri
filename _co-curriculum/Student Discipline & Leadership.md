## EDGE Approach

![](/images/Edge%20approachn.bmp)

We believe that every Edgefielder is a leader and will create opportunities for student leadership. Using the EDGE approach, our curriculum and programmes will help students develop a deeper understanding about leadership knowledge and skills.

## Experience
The **tiered-leadership pyramid** is a spiral progression that enables students to take on various leadership roles at the different tiers.

### Develop

All Edgefielders undergo the 7 habits of Highly Successful People programme from Primary 1 to 6. This programme ensures that they are equipped with the necessary skills to move towards self-leadership.

Tier 2 and Tier 3 leaders undergo **MICEE** trainings and **On-the-Job Trainings** (OJT) to develop the relevant skills to lead in their respective leadership roles.

### Grow

Our student leaders receive feedback during dialogue sessions and regular check-ins. Such opportunities enable them to be more reflective and work towards having a growth mindset that will prepare them to be resilient and adaptable leaders.
