<h3><strong>Student Well-being Department</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At the heart of our schoolâ€™s culture is the belief
that every child can be a positive influence and a caring peer supporter.
Our goal is to create a caring and enabling environment where all students
feel safe, supported and connected.
<br>
<br>We aim to build a prosocial and strong peer support culture, where students
look out for another and grow together. Students who demonstrate leadership
potential are appointed as Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). These PSLs are
trained and empowered with opportunities to lead with empathy, help their
peers bond and provide support for one another. &nbsp;
