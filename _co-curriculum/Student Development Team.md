<h3>A Quality Edgefield Experience</h3>
<p>The Student Development Team@Edgefield ensures a balanced and holistic
school experience for all students, supporting their overall growth. Like
tiny seedlings when they first enter the school, our students undergo a
rich array of school experiences across their six years here with us and
flourish into curious and confident young learners ready to brave their
journey ahead alongside others.</p>

<h3>Supporting Student Well-Being</h3>
<p>Students thrive best in an environment that is safe and where positive
emotions flow. We do this by providing opportunities for all Edgefielders
to experience Positive emotions, promote student Engagement, build meaningful
Relationships, understand the Meaning behind all that they do and celebrate
their Accomplishments (PERMA).</p>

<h3>I AM POSSIBLE</h3>
<p>I Am Possible is a school programme that aims to develop the holistic
potential of selected students in our school. Here, students are taught
life skills, self-management skills and school values through various exciting
and engaging activities.</p>
<p>We collaborate with SportsSg to run some of these activities. Previously,
they conducted indoor futsal, coached by two former national players. This
year, we have badminton clinics. Students also have fun learning about
mindfulness and making their own terrariums. They may also discover their
acting potential in the ‘Nature Through Drama’ skit organised by NParks.</p>
