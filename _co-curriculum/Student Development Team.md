<h3>A Quality Edgefield Experience</h3>
<p>The Student Development Team@Edgefield ensures a balanced and holistic
school experience for all students, supporting their overall growth. Like
tiny seedlings when they first enter the school, our students undergo a
rich array of school experiences across their six years here with us and
flourish into curious and confident young learners ready to brave their
journey ahead alongside others.</p>

<h3>Supporting Student Well-Being</h3>
<p>Students thrive best in an environment that is safe and where positive
emotions flow. We do this by providing opportunities for all Edgefielders
to experience <strong>P</strong>ositive emotions, promote student <strong>E</strong>ngagement,
build meaningful <strong>R</strong>elationships, understand the <strong>M</strong>eaning
behind all that they do and celebrate their <strong>A</strong>ccomplishments
(<strong>PERMA</strong>).</p>

<h3>Peer Support Relationships</h3>
<p>In line with the CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework, our school has established
a Peer Support Relationship (PSR) structure. PSR is critical for building
a caring and enabling school environment.</p>
<p>Having strong PSR helps our students feel more connected to others. This
sense of relatedness goes a long way in increasing their motivation to
attend school. As students learn to look out for one another, PSR also
serves as an extra layer of safety net for our children when they require
help.</p>
<h3>2 Tiers of Implementation for PSR</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tier 1 programmes are for all students. Every student can be a peer supporter
with explicit teaching of basic PSR knowledge and skills, and provision
of opportunities for students to demonstrate PSR.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tier 2 programmes are for selected Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs make
up one of the main student leadership bodies in our school. These leaders
undergo specialized training to become more adept at skills required for
all three PSR domains.</p>

<h3>I-Am-Possible Programme</h3>
<p>I Am Possible is a school programme that aims to develop the holistic
potential of selected students in our school. Here, students are taught
life skills, self-management skills and school values through various exciting
and engaging activities.</p>
<p>This year, we are collaborating with CITY (Character In The Young) Community
Services to mentor and befriend our students.</p>
