### A Quality Edgefield Experience

The Student Development Team@Edgefield ensures a balanced and holistic school experience for all students, supporting their overall growth. Like tiny seedlings when they first enter the school, our students undergo a rich array of school experiences across their six years here with us and flourish into curious and confident young learners ready to brave their journey ahead alongside others.

### Supporting Student Well-Being

Students thrive best in an environment that is safe and where positive emotions flow. We do this by providing opportunities for all Edgefielders to experience Positive emotions, promote student Engagement, build meaningful Relationships, understand the Meaning behind all that they do and celebrate their Accomplishments (PERMA).

### I AM POSSIBLE

I Am Possible is a school programme that aims to develop the holistic potential of selected students in our school. Here, students are taught life skills, self-management skills and school values through various exciting and engaging activities. 

We collaborate with SportsSg to run some of these activities. Previously, they conducted indoor futsal, coached by two former national players. This year, we have badminton clinics. Students also have fun learning about mindfulness and making their own terrariums. They may also discover their acting potential in the ‘Nature Through Drama’ skit organised by NParks.
